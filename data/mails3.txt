In addition, an   effective RTW program can help an organization lower workers\u2019   compensation costs \u2013 such as temporary disability benefits, medical and   rehabilitation treatment and retraining costs \u2013 by getting workers back   to work while they are moving toward recovery.\nHowever, setting up a successful RTW program requires a delicate   balance. If you act too quickly to return an injured or sick employee to   work, you run the risk of re\u2011injuring the worker or exacerbating the   condition that landed an employee out of work in the first place. Also,   you need to adhere to a variety of different compliance obligations   under the ADA, FMLA, OSHA and state workers\u2019 compensation laws. Clear   policies and return\u2011to\u2011work agreements with carefully crafted and   consistently enforced expectations for all parties are crucial for   success.\nJoin us on November 13 when Patricia Eyres, a   skilled attorney, will discuss practical and specific steps for   employers when working with medical providers and employees to return   injured workers back to the job as quickly as possible.\nREGISTER NOW\nBy attending this webinar, you will:\nLearn how an early return\u2011to\u2011work program can benefit your organization; \nGain strategies for preparing an effective RTW policy and securing buy\u2011in from company executives\nUnderstand the relationship between return\u2011to\u2011work programs and workers\u2019 compensation, ADA, FMLA, and other legal considerations\nIdentify the key components of an effective Early RTW program description\nIdentify appropriate transitional assignments and match them to the needs of particular employees\nGain strategies for carefully crafting transitional work agreements to ensure that they set clear expectations for all parties\nLearn strategies for addressing ongoing changes in work restrictions while the employee is in a transitional assignment\nUnderstand the carrot vs. stick approach: how to handle injured employees who refuse a transitional light duty assignment\nUnderstand the pros and cons of limiting the length of a transitional or light duty assignment,\nIdentify best practices for communicating with supervisors to ensure   they understand and follow the RTW process and properly address   employees\u2019 medical limitations\nCan't attend?

            "msg_body": "Most of the time, people fail on the ketogenic diet because they\njust aren't prepared.\nYou see, Keto is really unlike any other way of eating. Typically,\nwith most diets,you can \"cheat\" on the diet and many times, it's\nactually encouraged.\nHowever, with most forms of Keto (minus those used by athletes),\nthe whole idea is to be ketogenic the whole time.  It's actually a\nrequirement.\nAnd almost everyone has to test themselves in the beginning to know\nwhat \"ketosis feels like\", otherwise, you statistically will have more\ncarbs and protein than needed and never actually get into ketosis... which\nfeels horrible.\nBecause of this, we encourage new Keto'ers (this means you!) to pick\nup an intro or starter program on Keto... one that has daily step by step\n\"do this, not that\". You really only need something that's 14 to 30 days\nlong and then you're in your groove and are set to go at it alone.\nFortunately, you can join our 28 Day Keto Challenge and have all this\ndone for you\nObviously, there are programs out there that do a great job as well.\nThe point is to get on something structured in the beginning.\nPreferably with some help.\nIf you're serious.\nIf not and you're just interested in learning about Keto but not applying,\nthen you shouldn't worry about it. However, if you're after\nresults, the proven first steps are structure, habit, and help.\nRemember, ketogenic diets are first and foremost, medical diets.\nTypically done UNDER SUPERVISION and for good reason.\nIt can be difficult to start and sustain.\nNevertheless, no good thing comes easy. Just make sure to stack the\nchips in your favor.\nAlways remember this.\n-Dave\nSoon after his resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City. To cover urgent tax and legal bills, and living expenses, he borrowed $200,000 from his friend Frank Sinatra. He had hoped he could resume a career as a lawyer, but in 1974, the Maryland Court of Appeals disbarred him, calling him \"morally obtuse.\" To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. Describing his business methods, Agnew said: \"I have one utility, and that's the ability to penetrate to the top people.\" One deal concerned a contract for the supply of uniforms to the Iraqi Army, involving negotiations with Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceau\u00c5\u009fescu of Romania.\nAgnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer Doug Sanders over a beer distributionship in Texas. In 1976 he published a novel, The Canfield Decision, about an American vice president's troubled relationship with his president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, with Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone. The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George\nCanfield, refers to \"Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies\" and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted was true in real life. This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for re-election. Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: \"My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities\". Palm trees line a busy four-lane street Rancho Mirage, California, Agnew's home from 1977\nIn 1976, Agnew announced that he was establishing a charitable foundation \"Education for Democracy\", but nothing more was heard of this after B'nai B'rith accused it of being a front for Agnew's anti-Israeli views. Agnew was now wealthy enough to move in 1977 to a new home at The Springs Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, and shortly afterwards to repay the Sinatra loan. That year, in a series of televised interviews with British TV host David Frost, Nixon claimed that he had had no direct role in the\nprocesses that had led to Agnew's resignation and implied that his vice president had been hounded by the liberal media: \"He made mistakes ... but I do not think for one minute that Spiro Agnew consciously felt that he was violating the law\". In 1980, Agnew published a memoir, Go Quietly ... or Else. In it, he protested his total innocence of the charges that had brought his resignation, and claimed that he had been coerced by the White House to \"go quietly\" or face an unspoken threat of possible assassination, a suggestion that Coffey describes as \"absurd\". Agnew's assertions of innocence were undermined when his former lawyer George White testified that his client had admitted statehouse bribery to him, saying it had been going on \"for a thousand years.\"\n",

Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid at the start of 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day. Agnew, standing, speaks into a microphone as others seated in the row of spectators nearby look on. Spiro Agnew congratulates launch control after the launch of Apollo 17 in 1972 Nixon instructed Agnew to avoid personal attacks on the press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver. Nixon took the high road in the campaign, but still wanted McGovern attacked for his positions, and the task fell in part to Agnew. The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, and wanted to be perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a \"desperate candidate who can't seem to understand that the American people don't want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them\". The race was never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 percent of the vote in gaining re-election. Trying to position himself as the frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.

Today, however, ICU refers more to the intensity of the interventions undergone by the patient. In an opinion piece published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Brian L. Block, MD, of the division of pulmonary, allergy, and critical care in the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, discusses the evolution of the term ICU, which was first coined in the mid-20th century, and the importance of names in setting the stage for the type of care given in a hospital setting. \n\u00a0READ MORE\n.\n\u00a0PRODUCT SHOWCASE\nIntensivistJobs, is the only nationwide recruitment firm specializing in Critical Care.

In 2011, when the CDC last did a survey, about 4 percent of patients got an infection in the hospital. Now that number is down to 3.2 percent, the CDC team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, the numbers are still enormous.  \n\u00a0READ MORE\nStudy reveals no benefit to costly and risky brain cooling after brain injury\nMonash University via Medical Xpress\nAn estimated 50-60 million people, worldwide, will suffer a traumatic brain injury this year, and more than half of the world's population will suffer at least one TBI during their lifetime. There has long been controversy around the benefits of brain cooling in the Intensive Care Unit following a TBI, in the belief the cooling or hypothermia reduces brain inflammation and consequent brain damage. Now, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that hypothermia treatment presents no definitive benefit. \n\u00a0READ MORE\nAdvertisement\n3 Ways Point of Care Ultrasound Can Improve Sepsis Outcomes\nGE Healthcare\nSeptic shock is a leading cause of death worldwide \u2013 and strikes more than 1 million Americans every year at an annual cost of more than $20 billion dollars.

In addition to lack of efficacy against bloodstream infections, \"there is no beneficial effect on survival of ICU patients, which is in contrast with previous studies performed in settings with lower levels of antibiotic resistance,\" Dr. Bastiaan Wittekamp of University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands told Reuters Health by email. \n\u00a0READ MORE\nIn the crusade against physician burnout, some preach 'resilience' \u2014 but it's not that simple\nSTAT (opinion)\nRich Joseph, MD, writes, \"There's no question that resilience is a central element not just of physician well-being but of human well-being.

But to physicians who grapple with burnout, the 'solution' of boosting resilience falsely implies a baseline deficiency of it. Anyone who has made it through medical school and is working as a physician has demonstrated ample resilience time and again. So the prescription of more resilience is not only hollow but insulting.\" \n\u00a0READ MORE\nTime on ventilator not shortened by weaning to noninvasive ventilation\nReuters Health News via MDLinx\nIn ventilated patients who fail a spontaneous breathing test, early extubation and weaning to noninvasive ventilation using a protocolized regimen does not significantly shorten time to liberation from all forms of mechanical ventilation, although it does lessen invasive ventilation and sedation, researchers say. Although a recent trial found no difference in the primary outcome of time to liberation from all forms of ventilation, he noted, \"the noninvasive weaning intervention was associated with 3 days less invasive ventilator days and 1 day less total ventilator days. Sedation and use of respiratory antibiotics were less and patients spent less time in critical care in the noninvasive weaning group,\" according to Dr. Gavin Perkins of the University of Warwick. \"This study challenges existing beliefs that those who fail a spontaneous breathing trial must continue with invasive mechanical ventilation,\" he said. \"It opens up opportunities for further research into the most effective weaning strategies.\"\n\u00a0READ MORE\n.\n\u00a0PRODUCT SHOWCASE\nLook what you are missing!\nA great chance to be part of the largest and fastest growing Intensivist group in the US!

Some studies have suggested large mortality benefits for some, while others showed little benefit or even harm. Now, new research suggests that the effectiveness of individual ICU telemedicine programs may be influenced by modifiable factors. Having clearly defined roles and expectations for telemedicine personnel and clear buy-in from bedside providers were two common features of high performing ICU telemedicine programs, found Jeremy Kahn, MD, and colleagues, all from the University of Pittsburgh. \n\u00a0READ MORE\nNew guidance recommends minimal oxygen for most inpatients\nMedscape (free login required)\nAs part of the \"Rapid Recommendations\" initiative of the BMJ, a panel of experts \u2014 including specialists, a nurse, a surgeon, a respiratory therapist and patients \u2014 evaluated a recent systematic review and meta-analysis and developed recommendations regarding supplemental oxygen therapy. Key recommendations include maintaining peripheral capillary oxygen saturation at or below 96 percent for patients receiving supplemental oxygen therapy and abstaining from administering oxygen for patients with acute myocardial infarction or stroke if initial oxygen saturation is at least 92 percent. \n\u00a0READ MORE\n\u00a0TRENDING ARTICLES\nMissed last week's issue?

            "msg_body": "Most of the time, people fail on the ketogenic diet because they\njust aren't prepared.\nYou see, Keto is really unlike any other way of eating. Typically,\nwith most diets,you can \"cheat\" on the diet and many times, it's\nactually encouraged.\nHowever, with most forms of Keto (minus those used by athletes),\nthe whole idea is to be ketogenic the whole time.  It's actually a\nrequirement.\nAnd almost everyone has to test themselves in the beginning to know\nwhat \"ketosis feels like\", otherwise, you statistically will have more\ncarbs and protein than needed and never actually get into ketosis... which\nfeels horrible.\nBecause of this, we encourage new Keto'ers (this means you!) to pick\nup an intro or starter program on Keto... one that has daily step by step\n\"do this, not that\". You really only need something that's 14 to 30 days\nlong and then you're in your groove and are set to go at it alone.\nFortunately, you can join our 28 Day Keto Challenge and have all this\ndone for you\nObviously, there are programs out there that do a great job as well.\nThe point is to get on something structured in the beginning.\nPreferably with some help.\nIf you're serious.\nIf not and you're just interested in learning about Keto but not applying,\nthen you shouldn't worry about it. However, if you're after\nresults, the proven first steps are structure, habit, and help.\nRemember, ketogenic diets are first and foremost, medical diets.\nTypically done UNDER SUPERVISION and for good reason.\nIt can be difficult to start and sustain.\nNevertheless, no good thing comes easy. Just make sure to stack the\nchips in your favor.\nAlways remember this.\n-Dave\nSoon after his resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City. To cover urgent tax and legal bills, and living expenses, he borrowed $200,000 from his friend Frank Sinatra. He had hoped he could resume a career as a lawyer, but in 1974, the Maryland Court of Appeals disbarred him, calling him \"morally obtuse.\" To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. Describing his business methods, Agnew said: \"I have one utility, and that's the ability to penetrate to the top people.\" One deal concerned a contract for the supply of uniforms to the Iraqi Army, involving negotiations with Saddam Hussein and Nicolae Ceau\u00c5\u009fescu of Romania.\nAgnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer Doug Sanders over a beer distributionship in Texas. In 1976 he published a novel, The Canfield Decision, about an American vice president's troubled relationship with his president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, with Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone. The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George\nCanfield, refers to \"Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies\" and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted was true in real life. This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for re-election. Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: \"My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities\". Palm trees line a busy four-lane street Rancho Mirage, California, Agnew's home from 1977\nIn 1976, Agnew announced that he was establishing a charitable foundation \"Education for Democracy\", but nothing more was heard of this after B'nai B'rith accused it of being a front for Agnew's anti-Israeli views. Agnew was now wealthy enough to move in 1977 to a new home at The Springs Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, and shortly afterwards to repay the Sinatra loan. That year, in a series of televised interviews with British TV host David Frost, Nixon claimed that he had had no direct role in the\nprocesses that had led to Agnew's resignation and implied that his vice president had been hounded by the liberal media: \"He made mistakes ... but I do not think for one minute that Spiro Agnew consciously felt that he was violating the law\". In 1980, Agnew published a memoir, Go Quietly ... or Else. In it, he protested his total innocence of the charges that had brought his resignation, and claimed that he had been coerced by the White House to \"go quietly\" or face an unspoken threat of possible assassination, a suggestion that Coffey describes as \"absurd\". Agnew's assertions of innocence were undermined when his former lawyer George White testified that his client had admitted statehouse bribery to him, saying it had been going on \"for a thousand years.\"\n",

The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success.\nHaving issues seeing the picture ? Discover Here. \nAuthentic Ukrainian Beauties on line\nA flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure a href=\"http://ukaringirlfree1.us/clk.0_41425_43680_322270_8630_16865_0300_0ccb7c17\">\nfound in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. Although the arrangement described above is considered \"typical\", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure. These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species. The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another part. In some families, like Ranunculaceae, the petals are greatly reduced and in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of Peonies and Roses are mostly petaloid stamens. Flowers show great variation and plant scientists describe this variation in a systematic way to identify and distinguish species. Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are connate, while fused parts originating from different whorls are adnate; parts that are not fused are free. When petals are fused into a tube or ring that falls away as a single unit, they are sympetalous (also called gamopetalous). Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the cylindrical base is the tube, the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is bilabiate. Flowers with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform, tubular, urceolate, salverform or rotate. .\n",

Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid at the start of 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day. Agnew, standing, speaks into a microphone as others seated in the row of spectators nearby look on. Spiro Agnew congratulates launch control after the launch of Apollo 17 in 1972 Nixon instructed Agnew to avoid personal attacks on the press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver. Nixon took the high road in the campaign, but still wanted McGovern attacked for his positions, and the task fell in part to Agnew. The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, and wanted to be perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a \"desperate candidate who can't seem to understand that the American people don't want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them\". The race was never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 percent of the vote in gaining re-election. Trying to position himself as the frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.

            "msg_body": "Hi,\nIf you've never heard of Glen Anderson, then here's the skinny.\nLike you, he's a video gamer. But he's a gamer with a difference.\nBecause he discovered that he could actually get paid to play games (yes, really!).\nSo, he eventually quit his job and started to make his living simply playing video games - or, rather, testing brand new games before they are released to the general public.\nThat way the game creators know their games will perform properly under fire, when the general public get their hands on them.\nAnd, for this vital service, Glen got paid up to 30 bucks an hour! Sweet!\nBut Glen didn't stop there, because he saw there were tons of video game makers that needed testers - which is where you're set to cash in BIG TIME.\nBecause he's forged strong links with all these top game creators (especially the biggest payers!) and set up a private web site to put these guys in touch with guys like you who are smart enough to know that when they are playing the latest games - even before they hit Main Street - they are ALSO getting paid for doing it.\nSo check this out, right now and take the dollar test drive: you'll be glad you did !\nSincerely.\n\t\t\tJustin\nP.S. And here's the best bit, you get to KEEP the games. So just imagine the reaction of your gaming buddies when they've paid big bucks to buy the game - and you tell them, not only did you play it weeks ago, it didn't cost you a single red cent AND you actually got paid to play it. Here's the heads up again:\nOn November 20 in Montgomery, Alabama, Agnew reinforced his earlier speech with an attack on The New York Times and The Washington Post, again originated by Buchanan. Both papers had enthusiastically endorsed Agnew's candidacy for governor in 1966 but had castigated him as unfit for the vice presidency two years later. The Post in particular had been hostile to Nixon since the Hiss case in the 1940s. Agnew accused the papers of sharing a narrow viewpoint alien to most Americans. Agnew alleged that the newspapers were trying to circumscribe his First Amendment right to speak of what he believed, while demanding unfettered freedom for themselves, and warned, \"the day when the network commentators and even the gentlemen of The New York Times enjoyed a form of diplomatic immunity from comment and criticism of what they said is over.\" After Montgomery, Nixon sought a d\u00e9tente with the media, and Agnew's attacks ended. Agnew's approval rating soared to 64 percent in late November, and the Times called him \"a formidable political asset\" to the administration. The speeches gave Agnew a power base among conservatives, and boosted his presidential chances for the 1976 election. 1970: Protesters and midterm elections Agnew's strong attacks on the administration's opponents, and the flair with which he made his addresses, made him popular as a speaker at Republican fundraising events. He traveled over 25,000 miles (40,000 km) on behalf of the Republican National Committee in early 1970, speaking at a number of Lincoln Day events, and supplanted Reagan as the party's leading fundraiser. Agnew's involvement had Nixon's strong support. In his Chicago speech, the vice president attacked \"supercilious sophisticates\", while in Atlanta, he promised to continue speaking out lest he break faith with \"the Silent Majority, the everyday law-abiding American who believes his country needs a strong voice to articulate his dissatisfaction with those who seek to destroy our heritage of liberty and our system of justice\". Agnew continued to try to increase his influence with Nixon, against the opposition of Haldeman, who was consolidating his power as the second most powerful person in the administration. Agnew was successful in being heard at an April 22, 1970, meeting of the National Security Council. An impediment to Nixon's plan for Vietnamization of the war in Southeast Asia was increasing Viet Cong control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew's vigorous support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation. The continuing student protests against the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went on Face the Nation to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, \"When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run into the room and whisper ... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here\". The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to \"a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate\". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it. Nixon's agenda had been impeded by the fact that Congress was controlled by Democrats and he hoped to take control of the Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority. On September 10 in Springfield, Illinois, speaking on behalf of Republican Senator Ralph Smith, Agnew began his campaign, which would be noted for harsh rhetoric and memorable phrases. Agnew attacked the \"pusillanimous pussyfooting\" of the liberals, including those in Congress, who Agnew said cared nothing for the blue- and white-collar workers, the \"Forgotten Man of American politics\". Addressing the California Republican Convention in San Diego, Agnew targeted \"the nattering nabobs of negativism. They have formed their own 4-H Club\u2014the 'Hopeless, Hysterical, Hypochondriacs of History'.\" He warned that candidates of any party who espoused radical views should be voted out, a reference to New York Senator Charles Goodell, who was on the ballot that November, and who opposed the Vietnam War. Believing that the strategy was working, Nixon met with Agnew at the White House on September 24, and urged him to continue. Nixon wanted to get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been appointed by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.

But he's a gamer with a difference.\nBecause he discovered that he could actually get paid to play games (yes, really!).\nSo, he eventually quit his job and started to make his living simply playing video games - or, rather, testing brand new games before they are released to the general public.\nThat way the game creators know their games will perform properly under fire, when the general public get their hands on them.\nAnd, for this vital service, Glen got paid up to 30 bucks an hour! Sweet!\nBut Glen didn't stop there, because he saw there were tons of video game makers that needed testers - which is where you're set to cash in BIG TIME.\nBecause he's forged strong links with all these top game creators (especially the biggest payers!) and set up a private web site to put these guys in touch with guys like you who are smart enough to know that when they are playing the latest games - even before they hit Main Street - they are ALSO getting paid for doing it.\nSo check this out, right now and take the dollar test drive: you'll be glad you did !\nSincerely.\n\t\t\tJustin\nP.S. And here's the best bit, you get to KEEP the games. So just imagine the reaction of your gaming buddies when they've paid big bucks to buy the game - and you tell them, not only did you play it weeks ago, it didn't cost you a single red cent AND you actually got paid to play it. Here's the heads up again:\nOn November 20 in Montgomery, Alabama, Agnew reinforced his earlier speech with an attack on The New York Times and The Washington Post, again originated by Buchanan. Both papers had enthusiastically endorsed Agnew's candidacy for governor in 1966 but had castigated him as unfit for the vice presidency two years later. The Post in particular had been hostile to Nixon since the Hiss case in the 1940s. Agnew accused the papers of sharing a narrow viewpoint alien to most Americans. Agnew alleged that the newspapers were trying to circumscribe his First Amendment right to speak of what he believed, while demanding unfettered freedom for themselves, and warned, \"the day when the network commentators and even the gentlemen of The New York Times enjoyed a form of diplomatic immunity from comment and criticism of what they said is over.\" After Montgomery, Nixon sought a d\u00e9tente with the media, and Agnew's attacks ended. Agnew's approval rating soared to 64 percent in late November, and the Times called him \"a formidable political asset\" to the administration. The speeches gave Agnew a power base among conservatives, and boosted his presidential chances for the 1976 election. 1970: Protesters and midterm elections Agnew's strong attacks on the administration's opponents, and the flair with which he made his addresses, made him popular as a speaker at Republican fundraising events. He traveled over 25,000 miles (40,000 km) on behalf of the Republican National Committee in early 1970, speaking at a number of Lincoln Day events, and supplanted Reagan as the party's leading fundraiser. Agnew's involvement had Nixon's strong support. In his Chicago speech, the vice president attacked \"supercilious sophisticates\", while in Atlanta, he promised to continue speaking out lest he break faith with \"the Silent Majority, the everyday law-abiding American who believes his country needs a strong voice to articulate his dissatisfaction with those who seek to destroy our heritage of liberty and our system of justice\". Agnew continued to try to increase his influence with Nixon, against the opposition of Haldeman, who was consolidating his power as the second most powerful person in the administration. Agnew was successful in being heard at an April 22, 1970, meeting of the National Security Council. An impediment to Nixon's plan for Vietnamization of the war in Southeast Asia was increasing Viet Cong control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew's vigorous support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation. The continuing student protests against the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went on Face the Nation to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, \"When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run into the room and whisper ... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here\".

While there are almost endless possibilities for photo editing with Photoshop, there can be a lot to learn.\nClick Here For More Details About This Tutorial + Bigger Images \nIn early 1973, shortly after assuming the role of United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, George Beall opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done then would be past the statute of limitations. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew five percent of the value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor. Investigative reporters and Democratic operatives had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt during his years as a Maryland official, but they had not been able to substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The vice president's personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew's name. In June, Matz's attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. These later payments would not be barred by the statute of limitations; Agnew could be prosecuted. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and at the end of the month Nixon, through his chief of staff, Alexander Haig, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's attorney, formally advising that the vice president was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash. Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, \"every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew\". Richardson, whom Nixon had ordered to take personal responsibility for the investigation, met with Agnew and his attorneys on August 6 to outline the case, but Agnew denied culpability, saying the selection of Matz's firm had been routine, and the money campaign contributions. The story broke in The Wall Street Journal later that day. Agnew publicly proclaimed his innocence and on August 8 held a press conference at which he called the stories \"damned lies\". Nixon, at a meeting on August 7, assured Agnew of his complete confidence, but Haig visited Agnew at his office and suggested that if the charges could be sustained, Agnew might want to take action prior to his indictment. By this time, the Watergate investigation that would lead to Nixon's resignation was well advanced, and for the next two months, fresh revelations in each scandal were almost daily fare in the newspapers. Under increasing pressure to resign, Agnew took the position that a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded that it would be improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation. On October 10, 1973, Agnew appeared before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed that there would be no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, Agnew submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the United States. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.

            "msg_body": "Good Evening,\nI have decided to take a break from jumps racing\u00a0for just one week\u00a0to look at the flat and, in particular, last weekend\u2019s Breeders Cup and the upcoming Melbourne Cup. \u00a0 There\u2019s no horse for the tracker this week, but I have provided a Melbourne Cup selection and a Monday stat.\nThere\u2019s no better jockey for the big occasion than Frankie Dettori, is there? Once again, his big race riding skills were in evidence at Churchill Downs on Saturday. A Breeders Cup double for the genius of a jockey, as he piloted Expert Eye\u00a0and Enable to victories in the Turf Mile and Turf respectively.\nThe Churchill Downs Turf track looked more like a ploughed field, and I didn\u2019t think the ground would suit the Sir Michael Stoute trained Expert Eye. So, I went for the Chad Brown trained Analyze It, each way. The colt was soon in the lead, and when his jockey quickened two furlongs out, it looked a race-winning move. Sadly, he was headed in the final few yards by the eventual runners who were\u00a0then headed by Expert Eye.\u00a0Frankie produced Expert Eye with a well-timed run to get up on the line. It\u2019s was a great ride from Dettori, on a horse who wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed underfoot conditions\nRecent Arc winner Enable was the star\u00a0turn on the evening, and she duly obliged her supporters by winning the 1m 4f Turf. The filly was caught out five wide coming into the straight she galloped on too\u00a0strong for her twelve rivals. Once taking the lead two out, no horse really looked like passing her, although Magical did throw down a big challenge between the final two furlongs. She never really looked like she would catch the winner though, and had to settle for second, beaten \u00be of a length.\nEnable is one hell of racehorse that\u2019s for sure. She overcome her \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0wide trip to not only win the Turf, but become the first horse to do the Arc & Breeders Cup Turf double in the same season.\nI will end this on a more controversial note. I don\u2019t like dirt racing, and the latest running of the Breeders Cup Classic just confirmed my dislike even more. Yet another dirt race where they go off like 6f sprinters, and then roll around like legless drunks in the straight. It\u2019s boring and monotonous.\nMy viewing of the race was further tarnished by the \u2018thrashing\u2019 that Thunder Snow endured from his jockey in the final few furlongs. Yeah, I know the whips are soft but you could hear the whips cracking during the commentary on the race. It didn\u2019t make for good viewing or listening in any way.\nThankfully, we will never see scenes like that in British horseracing ever again. I can\u2019t remember who won the race, and I don\u2019t\u00a0care either.\nMelbourne Cup:\nExpect Fireworks from Finche...\nIt\u2019s \u201cThe Race That Stops A Nation\u201d in the early hours of Tuesday morning UK time. Yes, it\u2019s the Melbourne Cup.\nI won\u2019t go through all the runners, but I do like the chance of the ex-french trained Finche. The 4-year-old wasn\u2019t over raced when trained by Andre Fabre, having just the 8 starts and winning three of them, including a Group 2 at Maisons-Laffitte, last year and a Group 3 on his final start in France at Deauville back in August. That win came over an extended 1m 4f, although the son of Frankel has had to prove his stamina for 2m.\nFinche showed he had acclimatised to his new surroundings with an excellent 3rd placed effort in the Geelong Cup, just beaten by two race-fit rivals. He remains open to further improvement\u00a0and, if he stays, he can get into the places at the very least.\nHe still runs in the Prince Khalid Abdullah silks, and could easily provide an incredible few days for the owner after Enable\u2019s and Expert Eyes\u2019 wins at the Breeders Cup.\nFinche is still available to back at 25/1 and looks worth an each-way play.\nNovember Handicap Bring Curtain Down\nBetfred November Handicap Cl2 (3yo+) - 1m4f\nThe final rites of the 2018 flat season are administered at Doncaster on Saturday. It\u2019s also the latest renewal of the November Handicap. Looking at the ten-year trends we have had 10 winners from 218 runners with 39 placed.\nHere are some interesting trends for you to digest:\nOdds SP: 20/1 & under\nBest In Three Runs: 1st or 2nd\nStall: Not First Quarter\nWeight: Top weight or within 13lb\nHorses with the above three traits have produced 9 winners from 48 runners\u00a0with\u00a014 placed. That\u2019s 90% of the winners from 20% of the total number of runners.\nMonday Stat:\nLast week, I highlighted the claims of the Marcus Tregoningtrained Landue (2/1) who won for us on Monday at Chelmsford.\nLet\u2019s hope for some more success today:\nKempton\nTrainer Jonathan Portman & jockey Richard Kingscotehave teamed up very successfully in the past year, in particular in handicap races: \u20136 winners from 19 runners 32% + 23.85 A/E 1.70, 10 placed 53%.\nThey team up with recent C&D winner Golden Iris. The 3-year-old looks a much better horse on the synthetics than the turf. Both her career wins have come on the all-weather, and her form figures on the surface are 121.\u00a0Up 4lb for that last win, she looks capable of going close again.\nGood luck with this week\u2019s punting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUntil next week.\nAll\u00a0the best,\nJohn Burke\nfor The Race Advisor\nYou're receiving this email because you requested to receive emails from the Race Advisor on 8/1/18, 8:57 AM from\u00a0\nYou can update your preferences here.\nTo unsubscribe from this\u00a0newsletter please click here.

While some defendants have since successfully challenged venue in that district on corporate residence grounds (the first prong of the patent venue statute, 35 USC Section 1400(b)), others have had to litigate the second prong of the statute not addressed in TC Heartland, under which suits can be brought where a defendant \u201chas committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business\u201d.

Limited had filed four cases against Alphabet (Google) this year. Since then, the floodgates have remained steadily open, with the NPEs hitting Google ten more times over the subsequent weeks. In May, Uniloc, a prolific plaintiff on its own, transferred over 600 US patent assets to Fortress, including much of a large portfolio that Uniloc had acquired in January 2018 from Pendrell Corporation. While many of the new cases against Google assert one of those former Pendrell assets, homegrown Uniloc patents and patents acquired from separate sources are at issue in others of those ten cases\u2014and Google is not alone. Three recent Fortress-Uniloc cases have brought the total number of cases filed against Apple since the beginning of 2017 north of 20; a new case against Samsung joins more than ten such others over that same time period; and in recent weeks, the NPEs have also tagged Disney (ABC, ESPN), Hulu, and Netflix with one case apiece.\nRead More >>\nOnce Again, American Patents Expands Assertion of Disparate Set of Former IV Patents\nAmerican Patents LLC ended October the same way it began the month\u2014adding\u00a0more cases to the litigation campaign that it started in September. The new suits name BlackBerry and TCL together (4:18-cv-00767); Best Buy, Hisense, Sharp,\u00a0 and TPV together (4:18-cv-00768); and Panasonic (4:18-cv-00766), all joining Acer, ASUS, HP, Huawei, LG Electronics (LGE), OnePlus, Samsung, and ZTE as defendants in the Eastern District of Texas. Across its complaints, American Patents targets\u2014with patents received from Intellectual Ventures LLC (IV)\u2014the provision of a variety devices (including laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs) offering Google\u2019s Chromecast streaming and/or keyboards with predictive text features and other features related to keyboard layout, as well as devices that support of Wi-Fi and/or cellular connectivity.\nRead More >>\nWith Fresh Leadership at the Helm, Acacia Reboots Another Campaign\nIn the wake of its recently announced leadership change, Acacia Research Corporation has revived yet another litigation campaign. Super Interconnect Technologies LLC (SIT), an Acacia affiliate, has filed suit against Alphabet (Google) (2:18-cv-00463) in the Eastern District of Texas; Huawei (2:18-cv-00462), Lenovo (1:18-cv-01729), Motorola Mobility (1:18-cv-01730), and Sony (1:18-cv-01731) in the District of Delaware; and ZTE (3:18-cv-02932) in the Northern District of Texas. SIT asserts three patents, generally related to communicating clock and data signals over a single clock transmission line, with mobile devices and laptops offering Universal Flash Storage (UFS) targeted across the campaign. In May 2016, a yearlong case against Samsung over the same three patents ended with a settlement during claim construction briefing.\nRead More >>\nNew Delaware NPE Kicks Off International Litigation Campaign over Large Image and Video Processing Patent Portfolio\nDynamic Data Technologies, LLC, a Delaware entity formed this past April, has launched an international litigation campaign over a large portfolio of patents recently acquired from MaxLinear. In the US, Dynamic Data has sued Amazon (2:18-cv-00461), AMD (1:18-cv-01715), HTC (1:18-cv-10180), NVIDIA (1:18-cv-01726), and Samsung (1:18-cv-00459) so far. In its complaints, however, the NPE pleads that it has begun enforcement actions against Alphabet (Google), AMD, and Microsoft in China (before the Nanjing Specialized Intellectual Property Tribunal) and against Apple in Germany. Dynamic Data further pleads that it is \u201cpursuing remedies for infringement of its patents\u201d in an effort to facilitate the licensing of \u201cfoundational technology\u201d in image and video processing developed by Philips, the history of which the NPE recounts in detail in its complaints, from making carbon-filament lamps in 1891 to work in the 1960s leading to patents alleged to disclose \u201ccutting-edge video compression and transmission technologies\u201d.\nRead More >>\nIP Edge Campaign Shifts from Mobile Check Deposit to Store Receipt Capture\nSapphire Crossing LLC, an affiliate of IP Edge LLC, has filed another wave of lawsuits in its file-and-dismiss campaign over a single image transfer patent. The latest defendants are Ibotta (1:18-cv-01716) and Quotient (1:18-cv-01717) in the District of Delaware and Groupon (1:18-cv-07277) in the Northern District of Illinois. Most earlier defendants were financial institutions, tagged over the provision of mobile banking apps offering mobile check deposit features; here, Sapphire Crossing focuses on mobile app features that allow the capture and upload of store receipt images.\nRead More >>\nMore Defendants Added to P2P Networking Campaign\nReigntek IP LLC, a possible affiliate of IP Edge LLC, has added Vivint (4:18-cv-00895) and Wowza Media Systems (1:18-cv-02798) to the campaign it began in September. The NPE\u2019s first wave of cases targeted BitTorrent (3:18-cv-05634), Microsoft (5:18-cv-00112), and Spotify (5:18-cv-05633) over the provision of various services that utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, alleging infringement of a single patent; those cases remain in initial pleadings. Both new complaints assert that same patent, with Vivint accused of infringement through the provision of the Smart Drive, a Wi-Fi-enabled storage device for home video surveillance footage that offers remote access and playback, and Wowza through its P2P video streaming platform.\nRead More >>\nIP Edge Kicks Off Campaign Focused on DC-HSPA+ Capable Devices\nIP Edge LLC has launched a fourth litigation campaign based on one or more of the 30 plus former Panasonic patents that the Texas monetization firm acquired from Allied Security Trust (AST) in January 2017. Mentone Solutions LLC, formed in mid-September, has filed suit against Acer (2:18-cv-00443), Inseego (1:18-cv-02767), MVG (1:18-cv-01713), NETGEAR (1:18-cv-01714), TCL (2:18-cv-00444), and T-Mobile (2:18-cv-00445) over a patent generally related to packet transmission in TDMA (time division multiple access) wireless networks. Targeted are devices with Dual-Carrier HSPA+ capability, the complaints calling out Acer\u2019s Swift 7 laptop, Inseego\u2019s SA2100 modem, MVG\u2019s NeptuLink, NETGEAR\u2019s LTE modems (e.g., LB2120), TCL\u2019s LINKZONE hotspot, and T-Mobile\u2019s Rocket 3.0 4G modem.\nRead More >>\nView in Browser |\n    Feedback |\n    Privacy Policy |\n    Terms of Service\n      | Unsubscribe\n                                Copyright \u00a9 2018 RPX Corporation.

Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb. Lily, petal The flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a wide range of colors including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a \"Turk's cap\". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule. stamen of lilium Seeds ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates. Naturally most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species which distribute in hot summer and mild winter area (Lilium candidum, Lilium catesbaei, Lilium longiflorum) lose leaves and remain relatively short dormant in Summer or Autumn, sprout from Autumn to winter, forming dwarf stem bearing a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficient chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.

It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.  Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the \"right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food\", as well as the \"fundamental right to be free from hunger\". \n",

It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry.  Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the \"right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food\", as well as the \"fundamental right to be free from hunger\". \n",

BUT if you don't have a subscription and would\u00a0like to join the webinar\u00a0you can! Just become a Digiterati INSIDER.\nINSIDERS get access to the Members Workshop as well as membership of\u00a0our hugely popular\u00a0INSIDE Track Facebook Group.\nOne of our Group members, Nick, told me the other day:\n\"I've cancelled my\u00a0expensive\u00a0DigitalMarketer subscription because everything I need is either in Digiterati Academy or can be asked in\u00a0their\u00a0Facebook Group\"\nWhat does being a Digiterati INSIDER\u00a0cost?\nDigiterati INSIDERS\u00a0membership is\u00a0$19 a month and gets you access to the Members Workshops AND our\u00a0INSIDE Track Facebook Group. But that's not all!\u00a0I've listed everything you get at the end of this email.\nWe reckon that's pretty amazing value\u00a0for inside\u00a0access to our team, tapping into our significant experience and expertise, and to Ask Us Anything for an hour each month!\u00a0\nBUT we've done something even better for you, Thomas as one of our loyal email subscribers....\nAs we're launching the first Members Workshop this week, and I'm so excited at what we have planned for it, we are offering you a very special discount.\nJoin this week and pay just $1 for the first month!\nYep. The price for your first month is just\u00a0$1 when you use this coupon code:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SEEYOUINSIDE\n(Be quick, this coupon expires after the first Members Workshop on 8th November!)\nYou should\u00a0sign up here.\nYou can cancel anytime or, if you love what you get (I'm sure you will), you'll just be billed\u00a0$19 per month going forwards.\nQuestions?\nWhere can I find out more before I commit?\nNo problem. Hit the link below for\u00a0more information on the Members Workshop and the benefits of being a Digiterati INSIDER:\nFind Out More About Digiterati INSIDERS\nDo I have to attend the Members Workshop webinar live?\nNo. There will be a replay available which will be added to your very own\u00a0Digiterati Academy Library after the session,\u00a0but because it\u00a0is\u00a0quite an interactive session it's\u00a0always best if you can attend live.\nINSIDERS will also get a copy of the slide deck with all the relevant info.\nWhat's going to happen in the Workshop?\nThe idea is that you get to spend the time 'picking our brains' on whatever topic you have questions about. It might be some aspect of Facebook marketing or perhaps some other digital or technical question that is bugging you.\nIn the hot seat is myself and my colleague Carlton who is a guru on all things technical related to digital marketing.\nWe can help with your sales funnels, ads, email marketing, social an content marketing issues - you name it!\nWe'll include a short presentation on something that's working right now in digital (not spilling the beans on what that is this month but it's very cool and not something I've ever talked about in our masterclasses before).\nPlus we have a super-quick overview of digital marketing news. Not got time to trawl through hundreds of Tweets, Facebook updates and media news outlets? Don't waste your time!\u00a0We're doing the hard work for you with our Five Minute FAST Track to the latest digital marketing news.\nHow can I submit questions?\nWe'll answer questions on the fly throughout the workshop as time permits, but it would REALLY help us to have a few questions in advance. That way\u00a0we can be really focused on YOU (and prepare any screen grabs for the slide deck)! So click the button below to submit your questions. You can submit the\u00a0form more than once if you suddenly have a new question or idea.\nSubmit your questions!\nI've done webinars before and have found them full of hard sales\nWe promise not to include any\u00a0sales waffle - the content will be focused and useful. The Members Workshop is definitely NOT a place where we are trying to sell anything. We hate webinars that are basically dressed-up sales pitches!\nRemind me of what I'm getting here\nYour $19 (actually, just $1 for your first month when\u00a0you use the coupon code SEEYOUINSIDE) makes you a Digiterati INSIDER which gets you access to the webinar, our member community Facebook Group and a TON of other valuable resources:\nMembership of our INSIDE Track community (the FB Group)\nAccess to our monthly Members Workshop webinars\u00a0\nThe Five Minute FAST Track\u00a0with all the latest digital marketing news\nOpportunity to Ask Us Anything on the Workshop!\nAccess to all the replays of Workshops\nAccess to all the previous Workshop slide decks\nYour own private Digiterati Academy login and library (where you access replays and more)\nBONUS: We'll give you these Digiterati Facebook marketing resources inside your Academy library including:\nThe Ultimate Guide to Facebook Marketing\nFacebook Ads Mini-course\nFacebook Groups Checklist\nDigiterati's Cover Photo Guide\nPhotoshop Cover Photo Template (just updated for 2019!)\nThat's a LOT of value for only $19 per month!\nPlus there is no long-term contract or commitment - you can cancel anytime if you feel you're not getting value from your membership.\nLooking forward to seeing you in the Members Workshop!\nDon't forget to use the coupon code SEEYOUINSIDE to pay just $1 for your first month. You can\u00a0sign up here.\n-- Marie\nMarie Page\nThe Digiterati // Digiterati Academy\nLeading UK Facebook Marketing Authority\nSocial Media Examiner & Smart Insights Contributor\nAmazon Bestselling Author\nMSc Digital Marketing and CIM Fellow\nP.S.

Baird Industrial Conference on Tue-Thu, National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts REIT World Convention on Wed-Thu.\nMarket Comments\nDec S&P 500 E-minis (ESZ18 +0.03%) this morning are up +4.75 points (+0.17%). \u00a0Friday's closes: S&P 500 -0.63%, Dow Jones -0.43%, Nasdaq 100 -1.47%. \u00a0The S&P 500 on Friday fell back from a 1-1/2 week high and closed lower on weakness in technology stocks, led by a 6% decline in Apple, after it forecast weaker-than-expected earnings growth and reported stagnant iPhone sales. \u00a0There was also weakness in energy stocks as crude oil prices tumbled -0.86% to a 6-3/4 month low. \u00a0Stocks were supported by hopes that the trade conflict between the U.S. and China may be resolved after President Trump said he wants to reach an agreement on trade with Chinese President Xi Jinping when both leaders meet at the G-20 summit in Argentina later this month. \u00a0Stocks were also supported by the +250,000 increase in U.S. Oct non-farm payrolls (stronger than expectations of +200,000) and by the +0.7% increase in U.S. Sep factory orders (stronger than expectations of +0.5%).\nDec 10-year T-notes (ZNZ18 +0-020) this morning are up +3.5 ticks. \u00a0Friday's closes: TYZ8 -17.00, FVZ8 -10.50. \u00a0Dec 10-year T-notes on Friday fell to a 1-1/2 week low and closed lower on the stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data on Oct non-farm payrolls and Sep factory orders, and also on supply pressures ahead of the Nov refunding that begins Monday where the Treasury will auction $83 billion of T-notes and T-bonds.\nThe dollar index (DXY00 +0.05%) this morning is up +0.061 (+0.06%), EUR/USD (^EURUSD -0.16%) is down -0.0020 (-0.18%), and USD/JPY (^USDJPY +0.06%) is up +0.06 (+0.05%). \u00a0Friday's closes: Dollar Index +0.265 (+0.28%), EUR/USD -0.0020 (-0.18%), USD/JPY +0.48 (+0.43%). \u00a0The dollar index on Friday recovered from a 1-week low and closed higher on stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data on Oct non-farm payrolls and Sep factory orders that was hawkish for Fed policy. \u00a0The dollar was also supported by the increase in T-note yields, which improved the dollar's interest rate differentials.\nMetals prices this morning are weaker with Dec gold (GCZ18 unch) -0.1 (-0.01%), Dec silver (SIZ18 -0.21%) -0.031 (-0.21%), and Dec copper (HGZ18 -1.12%) -0.026 (0.93%). \u00a0Friday's closes: Dec gold -5.3 (-0.43%), Dec silver -0.021 (-0.14%), Dec copper +0.0855 (+3.15%). \u00a0Metals on Friday settled mixed with Dec copper at a 1-1/2 week high. \u00a0Metals prices were supported by the better-than-expected U.S. economic data that is positive for industrial metals demand after Oct non-farm payrolls and Sep factory orders rose more than expected. \u00a0Industrial metals prices were also boosted by hopes that the U.S and China may resolve their trade differences, which would be positive for economic growth and industrial metals demand, after President Trump said he wants to reach a trade agreement with China at the G-20 summit in Argentina later this month. \u00a0Metals prices were undercut by the rebound in the dollar from 1-week low.\nDec WTI crude oil prices (CLZ18 -0.29%) this morning are down -21 cents (-0.33%) at a fresh 6-3/4 month low and Dec gasoline (RBZ18 -0.64%) is -1.28 (-0.75%). \u00a0Friday's closes: Dec crude oil -0.55 (-0.86%), Dec gasoline -0.82
