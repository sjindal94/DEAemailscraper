Barely able to budge.\nThen, just to be able to walk upright, I'd have to go through nearly 30 minutes of painful and tedious stretches.\nIt was like I had to talk my body into just doing basic movements.\nI would see those drawings of neanderthals from thousands of years ago hunched over and think: \"Yep that's me!\"\nAnd throughout the day I'd have to come back to that routine just so I could move around without holding onto walls and railings.\nBut all that changed when I found this.\nNow?

The renaming of the genus to Vachellia remains controversial. The genus name Acacia derives from the Greek word for its characteristic thorns, \u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2 (akis, thorn). The species name nilotica was given by Linnaeus from this tree's best-known range along the Nile river. The plant V. nilotica then, in turn, became the type species for the Linnaean genus Acacia (not all of which have thorns, even though they are named for them). For the ongoing reclassification of this and other species historically classified under genus Acacia, see the Acacia. Description Spring blossoms at Hodal in Faridabad District of Haryana, India Vachellia nilotica is a tree 5\u201320 m high with a dense spheric crown, stems and branches usually dark to black coloured, fissured bark, grey-pinkish slash, exuding a reddish low quality gum. The tree has thin, straight, light, grey spines in axillary pairs, usually in 3 to 12 pairs, 5 to 7.5 cm (3 in) long in young trees, mature trees commonly without thorns. The leaves are bipinnate, with 3\u20136 pairs of pinnulae and 10\u201330 pairs of leaflets each, tomentose, rachis with a gland at the bottom of the last pair of pinnulae. Flowers in globulous heads 1.2\u20131.5 cm in diameter of a bright golden-yellow color, set up either axillary or whorly on peduncles 2\u20133 cm long located at the end of the branches. Pods are strongly constricted, hairy, white-grey, thick and softly tomentose. Its seeds number approximately 8000/kg. \n",

            "msg_body": "The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success.\nHaving issues seeing the picture ? Discover Here. \nUkrainian girls looking for dating\nA flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure a href=\"http://ukaringirlfree1.us/clk.0_41425_43947_382965_8630_16863_0300_b28cc267\">\nfound in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. Although the arrangement described above is considered \"typical\", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure. These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species. The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another part. In some families, like Ranunculaceae, the petals are greatly reduced and in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of Peonies and Roses are mostly petaloid stamens. Flowers show great variation and plant scientists describe this variation in a systematic way to identify and distinguish species. Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are connate, while fused parts originating from different whorls are adnate; parts that are not fused are free. When petals are fused into a tube or ring that falls away as a single unit, they are sympetalous (also called gamopetalous). Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the cylindrical base is the tube, the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is bilabiate. Flowers with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform, tubular, urceolate, salverform or rotate. .\n",

Among these finds in the Aravah rift (also found a year earlier by German scholar Fritz Frank) were a large number of copper slag heaps and, even more surprising, seven camps where the copper smelters, or perhaps the miners, must have lived. On the basis of some pottery sherds found nearby, Glueck attributed this copper mining operation to King Solomon and concluded that here lay the source of much of his great wealth.\nBecome a Member\u00a0Now and Save 80%!\nExplore the world\u2019s most intriguing Biblical scholarship\nDig into more than 7,000 articles in the Biblical Archaeology Society\u2019s vast library, plus much more\u00a0with an All-Access pass.\nYES, I want my All-Access\u00a0pass! \nHazor, the Head of All Those Kingdoms\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe site of Hazor, located in upper Galilee, consists of a 30-acre upper tell, plus an adjacent plateau at a lower level of over 175 acres. The tell, unlike the plateau, was occupied almost continuously from the 27th century B.C. to the 2nd century B.C. By contrast, the plateau, or lower city, was a part of Hazor only during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, from about the time of Abraham to the Israelite conquest. This was the Canaanite period, when Hazor was at its zenith, when, as the Bible tells us, Hazor was \u201cthe head of all those kingdoms\u201d (Josh. 11:10), a characterization confirmed by archaeological excavations. In Canaanite times, Hazor was the largest city in the area. Excavations also confirm that this great city was destroyed and burned by Joshua (Josh. 11:11\u201312).\nWhere Is Biblical Debir?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDebir, a district capital of the Judean monarchy which figures prominently in Joshua and Judges, was misidentified by the great William F. Albright, according to Professor Moshe Kochavi of Tel Aviv University. Professor Kochavi argues that he, not Albright has excavated the true site of Debir\u2014at Khirbet Rabud, in the Judean hill country, twelve miles southwest of Hebron.\nHorned Altar for Animal Sacrifice Unearthed at Beer-Sheva\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first horned animal altar ever unearthed in ancient Israel was recently excavated by Professor Yohanan Aharoni at Tell Beer-Sheva. The exacavator dates the altar from the 8th century B.C. and possibly earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo read the full account of these stories\u2014and more articles!\u2014claim your BAS All-Access Subscription today.

We\u2019re filled with pride over the historic number of women inspired to make a difference and run. No matter whose name you mark on the ballot, it\u2019s a remarkable time to be a woman and vote for the candidate who represents your vision for the future. At Vagisil, we remember a time when the government tried to silence us, so we know all too well why representation matters. With that in mind, let\u2019s make herstory tomorrow!   \u00a0   WHAT WE\u2019RE DOING      Registered to vote but unsure of where to go? We got you.

VOTING SITE FIND IT     \u00a0 \u00a0    WHAT WE\u2019RE WONDERING      Is the surge in female candidates a fleeting trend or the new normal? We hope the latter. A similar spike occurred in the \u201890s, but didn\u2019t necessarily change the status quo. However, with so many self-motivated candidates throwing their hats into the ring this election cycle, their passion and momentum could change politics forever.    FLEETING MOMENT OR THE NORM? DEBATE IT     \u00a0 \u00a0    WHY VOTING IS IMPORTANT      Women make up more than half the US population, but are underrepresented in government by a 3 to 1 ratio. We make up just 19% of House members and 21% of the Senate. If a female candidate has you inspired, be sure to go out and cast your vote.    WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT CHECK IT     \u00a0 \u00a0    WHAT WE\u2019RE READING      Not to be confused with the iconic Brooklyn-born rapper, Notorious RBG is a retrospective on Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the pop culture icon and octogenarian who\u2019s had a seat on the Supreme Court for 25 years.

Then, in 2012, when his extended travels were coming to  an end, he had another idea...\nDanny wanted his next venture to have a social as well as an  economic mission. He had always been curious about cacao, and he realized that  chocolate production could be just the business idea he sought. \nDanny's timing was good. In recent years, the artisanal  cacao industry has been growing along with the global market for high-quality  chocolate. \nDanny wanted to create a custom product that was also  organic certified. He focused on Colombia, where he knew he could work directly  with farmers to ensure the quality of the final creation. \nAfter a year of testing different cacaos, Danny found an  organization on the Caribbean coast that supports organic farmers. Working with  this group allows Til\u00edn to pay the farmers it buys from more than the standard  market rate. This incentivizes farmers to perfect their fermentation process.\n\"It took about 18 months of development before I was  ready to start making chocolate,\" Danny remembers, \"and another six  more months before I was making good chocolate.\"\nToday, Til\u00edn is producing high-quality artisanal chocolate  that is also healthy. Til\u00edn chocolate is unique in that it uses very few and  very pure ingredients. \nThe 60% cacao bar, for example, consists of organic cacao  and organic panela (unprocessed cane  sugar grown in Colombia), and that's it. No added sweeteners or emulsifiers. \nAny additional ingredients\u2014herbal tea, artisanal coffee, or  sea salt, for example\u2014are incorporated to accentuate the flavor profile and  roast of the cacao. Just as the modern cocktail movement works to bring out the  flavors of small-batch liquor without overpowering it with sweeteners, Til\u00edn  brings out the best in its cacao, a process so meticulous that trials take  months.\nTil\u00edn chocolate is 100% handmade. Danny and his team are  hands-on throughout every step, first working directly with the farmers to  ferment only the best Colombian cacao beans. Then these beans are roasted and  crushed. The nibs are separated from the shells before the beans are ground to  create chocolate.\nNext, flavors are added and the chocolate is tempered  (settled), packaged, sealed, and shipped.\nThe mission of Til\u00edn Cacao is simple: Connect people to the  origins of cacao while showcasing the bounty of the superfoods that grow in  abundance in this historically misunderstood country. \nEssentially, Til\u00edn Cacao is working to connect people to  Colombia, creating a product that Colombians can be proud of and that the world  can enjoy while also educating people on health, superfoods, and the beautiful  land that is Colombia. \nTil\u00edn Cacao has come a long way in the five years since its  inception. What began in Danny's Poblado apartment\u2014which friends and guests  referred to as the \"chocolate laboratory\"\u2014expanded next to a friend's  garage.\n\"When we began selling to Pergamino Coffee Shop,  Namast\u00e9 Mercado de T\u00e9, and other local organic stores,\" Danny explains,  \"we needed larger machinery to be able to meet the demand.\"\nToday, Til\u00edn Cacao occupies its own space in Providencia, in  El Poblado. The space doubles as the chocolate factory and an educational store  where people can learn about the origins of cacao and the chocolate-making  process... while purchasing and tasting delicious Til\u00edn chocolate. \nStarting a business isn't easy, and starting a business in  another country comes with extra layers of challenge. \n\"Honestly, running a business in Colombia hasn't always  been easy... and I'm still learning as I go. \n\"You need to become familiar with the relevant laws,  and you also need to be respectful of the cultural differences. Things are done  a certain way in Colombia... just as things are done a certain way anywhere in  the world. You just need to learn those ways.\"\n\"Now, five years into this,\" Danny admits,  laughing, \"I ask myself what was I ever thinking to get into this crazy  business! It helps to keep a sense of humor.\"\nMost recently, Til\u00edn has partnered with some of its first  supporters, Namast\u00e9 Mercado de T\u00e9 and Pergamino Coffee, to create bars inspired  by their products.\nAnd Til\u00edn Cacao has been spotted on the shelves of shops in  Brooklyn, New York, and has made appearances in Germany at the ISM Sweets Expo  and the BioFach Organic Food Conference. \nColombian cacao is increasingly sought-after worldwide, and  Til\u00edn is in a prime position to capitalize on the expanding marketplace. Danny  is negotiating new partnerships in Europe. \nNext time you're in Medell\u00edn, you can pick up your Til\u00edn  Cacao products at Pergamino Coffee shop and Ceres Market in Providencia or at  Namast\u00e9 Mercado de T\u00e9 in Tesoro Mall and Zona Dos Mall in El Poblado. \nSoon you'll be able to shop for Til\u00edn chocolate at the Til\u00edn  interactive store and tasting laboratory to be opened on V\u00eda Jard\u00edn.\nMeantime, you can place orders online here.\nLauren Brown\n  Full-Time Colombia Expat\nEditor's Note: Dreaming of opening your own chocolate  shop? \nHow about a beach bar?

The first 125,000 pesos  (US$6,240) is exempt... and the 30% bracket starts at 1 million pesos (about  US$50,000 today).\nMexico  has a tax treaty with the United States, but rental income would be taxed by  Mexico. You'd then claim any tax you pay in Mexico as a credit on your U.S.  taxes. In other words, you'd pay tax on this income in Mexico but not in the  United States.\nYou would need to be tax-resident, with your primary home in  Mexico, before you'd become liable for tax in Mexico on any non-Mexican income.\nMore From Overseas Opportunity Letter...\nThe 9 Questions To Answer Before Launching A New Life In A New Country\nBy Kathleen Peddicord Nov. 4, 2018 \nLet your go-overseas plan develop organically\u2014this idea is infinitely customizable...\nRead More\nThanks for reading  Overseas Opportunity Letter, a free daily email service brought to you six days a week by Live and Invest Overseas publications.

            "msg_body": "Small neighborhood businesses and Fortune 500s alike are facing increased exposure to harassment and discrimination claims.\nEmployee Lawsuits Are Costly \u2013 Win or Lose. These 4 Trends Are Making the Risks More Severe.\nSmall neighborhood businesses and Fortune 500s alike are facing increased exposure to harassment and discrimination claims.\nBy: Starr Insurance Companies\nFor many companies these days, the  question is not if you will face an employment-related lawsuit, but when?\nNo matter how much you trust your  employees or managers or how thoroughly you focus on training, it is extremely  rare for a strategy to be 100 percent effective in avoiding claims of  harassment or discrimination.\n\u201cThe probability that a company will  get sued for an alleged employment practices violation has increased  dramatically; aggrieved employees drive some litigation, and, in other cases,  plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers encourage this type of claim,\u201d said Beth Goldberg, chief  underwriting officer, Financial Lines Division, Starr Insurance Companies.  \u201cThese claims can be expensive just to defend, even if they are groundless.\u201d\nAccording to Westlaw, a legal research  service by Thomson Reuters, plaintiffs win 51 percent of the time when  employment practices liability (EPL) claims go to trial.\nLosses from certain types of EPL  lawsuits are also getting larger. Employment law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP found  that settlements for the 10 biggest class actions increased 55 percent from  2016 to 2017.\nThese damages, of course, don\u2019t  reflect the long-term impact to a company\u2019s reputation. For all these reasons,  boards are starting to take notice that, in today\u2019s environment, an EPL  insurance policy is not just \u201cnice to have,\u201d but an absolute necessity.\nFour trends in particular are  currently driving greater EPL exposure:\n1.  It\u2019s not just about lost wages and compensation; juries are increasingly  focused on emotional damages.\n\u201cThe emotional distress and mental  anguish components can be larger than the monetary demand for front pay and  back pay,\u201d Goldberg said.\nAllegations from claimants may range  from discomfort and embarrassment to anxiety and depression. They may claim  that they\u2019ve lost sleep and their health has deteriorated, due to the trauma of  harassment or discrimination. Testimony from family, friends, and treating  psychologists or psychiatrists can buttress these claims and win over a jury.  It can be difficult to place a monetary value on these damages or argue with a  claimant\u2019s demand; determining what\u2019s fair is very subjective.\nSome federal discrimination statutes  place caps on damages that plaintiffs can seek, but they can seek larger  amounts by suing under different federal, state, and local laws that have no  cap.\nIn New Jersey, for example, two  brothers sued their former employer for racial discrimination, hostile work  environment and retaliation under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination  (LAD). The jury awarded them $2.5 million  in damages, including $800,000 in emotional distress damages to one brother,  and $600,000 to the other.\nBeth Goldberg\n                   Chief Underwriting Officer, Financial Lines Division, Starr Insurance Companies\n2.  Social media and movements like #MeToo intensify reputational risk. \nThe \u201cMe Too\u201d movement has brought  national attention to the issue of sexual harassment in and outside of the  workplace. And while \u201cMe Too\u201d has provided a platform for victims to speak  about their experiences and prompted a re-evaluation of what constitutes  appropriate behavior, it has also increased the public profile of claims that  may be false.\n\u201cHarassment has become a headline  risk, one that is magnified by the media and can present an even greater threat  to a company\u2019s reputation,\u201d said Lisa Lockhead, vice president, Head of Private  & Not For Profit \u2013 Financial Lines, Starr Insurance Companies. Thanks to  the power of social media, companies may be prosecuted in the court of public  opinion, before they have a chance to present an argument or defend themselves.  If the story gains enough traction, it could cost an executive his or her job  and it can cost the company its consumers\u2019 trust and loyalty.\n\u201cThis type of reputational damage  can happen even if a story is untrue,\u201d Lockhead said. \u201cThe suggestion of  misconduct may cast a cloud over the company\u2019s brand value, which may translate  into falling stock prices and long-term economic impact.\u201d\n3.  Plaintiffs' attorneys drive class action disability discrimination cases. \nDiscriminatory practices that  violate the Americans with Disabilities Act may similarly garner large settlements  and present reputational risk. Recently, attorneys have sought out such  potential problematic practices in places companies often overlook \u2014 their  company websites.\n\u201cThere has been a growing trend of  plaintiff lawyers going after companies who do not make their websites  accessible to the deaf and blind,\u201d Goldberg said. According to research from  Seyfarth Shaw LLP, plaintiffs filed 4,965 website accessibility lawsuits in the  first half of 2018. At this rate, there will be close to 10,000 such suits by  the end of the year \u2013 a 30 percent increase over 2017.\n\u201cPeople tend to associate  \u2018accessibility\u2019 with physical spaces, but essentially every company has a  website and this digital space is subject to the same oversight,\u201d Goldberg  said.\nPhysical spaces are still, however,  up for grabs. Attorneys in some states are increasingly targeting small retail  shops and corner stores that often lack the space to improve accessibility by  widening doorways or installing ramps. According to a 2017 report by the New  York Post, just five wheelchair-bound New Yorkers are behind almost 400 ADA  lawsuits targeting small businesses across the city.\nEven when store owners are renters,  they can still be held accountable for noncompliance with the ADA. \u201cThe  plaintiff firms are naming both (renters and owners) to go after the deep  pockets,\u201d Lockhead said.\n4.  Varying state regulations add complexity to compliance. \nIn addition to federal regulations,  companies must also contend with variances in state law.\n\"In particular, states vary in their protection of rights afforded to the LGBTQ community. Companies should have an understanding of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and what their obligations are as far as bathroom access, or using non-gendered pronouns, etc. What rights are protected and to what extent?\" Lockhead said.\nDiscrimination based on physical  appearance is also treated differently on a state-by-state basis. California,  for example, expressly bars employers from discriminating based on body type,  while New York does not.\n\u201cState laws go far beyond federal  regulations, and understanding the differences is especially important for  multi-state employers,\u201d Goldberg said.\nIt\u2019s  More Important Than Ever to Ensure Internal Controls Are in Place\nThere are several risk control and risk transfer strategies organizations can deploy to mitigate the EPL losses. Some basic controls are critical, like employee handbooks that detail a code of conduct, policies and procedures around hiring and firing, thorough training, and a dedicated leader of human resources.\nThe ADA published a 27-item checklist to help companies make their websites accessible. Most are easy fixes, such as including text descriptions for links and navigation menus, and HTML alt tags for images for hearing-impaired visitors, or corresponding audio descriptions for the visually-impaired. Sites should also offer a way to contact a web manager with questions or complaints about accessibility.\nThese adjustments are not resource-intensive, even for smaller companies. But companies also need to do an assessment of their corporate culture.\nPart of improving company culture is providing a way for employees to raise concerns without fear of retribution. To that end, \"providing a way for employees to report issues internally directly to the board \u2014anonymously if they wish \u2014 can help get ahead of potential claims. Change has to come from the top down,\" Lockhead said.\nTo learn more, visit www.starrcompanies.com/insurance/employmentpracticeliability. \nThis article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Starr Insurance Companies.

            "msg_body": "The transition to flowering is one of the major phase changes that a plant makes during its life cycle. The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success.\nHaving issues seeing the picture ? Discover Here. \nAuthentic Ukrainian Beauties on line\nA flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure a href=\"http://ukaringirlfree1.us/clk.0_41425_43947_359791_8630_16865_0300_ddee7ead\">\nfound in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. Although the arrangement described above is considered \"typical\", plant species show a wide variation in floral structure. These modifications have significance in the evolution of flowering plants and are used extensively by botanists to establish relationships among plant species. The four main parts of a flower are generally defined by their positions on the receptacle and not by their function. Many flowers lack some parts or parts may be modified into other functions and/or look like what is typically another part. In some families, like Ranunculaceae, the petals are greatly reduced and in many species the sepals are colorful and petal-like. Other flowers have modified stamens that are petal-like; the double flowers of Peonies and Roses are mostly petaloid stamens. Flowers show great variation and plant scientists describe this variation in a systematic way to identify and distinguish species. Specific terminology is used to describe flowers and their parts. Many flower parts are fused together; fused parts originating from the same whorl are connate, while fused parts originating from different whorls are adnate; parts that are not fused are free. When petals are fused into a tube or ring that falls away as a single unit, they are sympetalous (also called gamopetalous). Connate petals may have distinctive regions: the cylindrical base is the tube, the expanding region is the throat and the flaring outer region is the limb. A sympetalous flower, with bilateral symmetry with an upper and lower lip, is bilabiate. Flowers with connate petals or sepals may have various shaped corolla or calyx, including campanulate, funnelform, tubular, urceolate, salverform or rotate. .\n",

The injured worker\u2019s pain persists or worsens, prompting numerous procedures, treatments and often extended use of pain medication. Medical and indemnity costs keep piling up, and there\u2019s no clear end in sight. However, there a few factors that can play a significant role in what makes these claims so difficult to resolve.\nClick Here to Read More\n2\nYour Data Is Vital to You, But Do You Know How Much It\u2019s Really Worth?\n                                                                                                Data is the feedstock for pricing products, making it the primary asset of value. For others, data can become a separate revenue stream offered as a new product line or separate income stream. So as companies across all sectors evolve into digital enterprises, there is an increasing need to value a company\u2019s data as a tangible asset on the balance sheet.\nClick Here to Read More\nAdvertisement\n3\nBuild, Burn, Repeat? 6 Ways You Can Stop the Cycle in Wildfire Zones\n                                                                                                The ferocity of wildfires in recent years is making them seemingly impossible to fight, even with emergency crews pulling out every possible stop.

It's because they make $1,000s from them!\nIn this video , Tom Ericson reveals how you can use their simple battery restoration trick to bring dead batteries back to life.\nThis simple method  is incredibly easy to do and it only uses a couple inexpensive items most people already have in their house.\n\t\t\tThis method is something mechanics have used for years when you give them your old dead batteries. But now you can do this too because of this new video .\n\t\t\tWhat this short video to see how the simple method works:\n=>> Watch video \n\t\t\tBest Regards,\n\t\t\tEric\nAfter the publication of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. Students of Professor John F. Banzhaf III from the George Washington University Law School found four residents of the state of Maryland willing to put their names on a case that sought to have Agnew repay the state $268,482, the amount it was said he had taken in bribes, including interest and penalties, as a public employee. After two appeals by Agnew, he finally wrote a check for $268,482 that was turned over to Maryland State Treasurer William S. James in 1983. In 1989, Agnew applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. Agnew also was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities. Final years and death External video Spiro Agnew bust unveiling, U.S. Capitol building, May 24, 1995, C-SPAN\n\t\t\tWhen Nixon died in 1994, his daughters invited Agnew to attend the funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; over the years he had rejected various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. \"I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside\", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: \"I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony has less to do with Spiro Agnew than with the office I held\".\n\t\t\tAgnew remained fit and active into his seventies, playing golf and tennis regularly. On Wednesday, September 17, 1996, he was due to play tennis with a friend, but collapsed at his summer home in Ocean City the night before, and was taken to the hospital where he died the next day. The cause of death was acute leukemia, previously undiagnosed. The funeral, at Timonium, Maryland, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew's former Secret Service guards also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president, an honor guard of the combined military services fired a 21-gun salute at the graveside. Agnew's wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012. Legacy\n\t\t\tAt the time of his death, Agnew's legacy was perceived largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians \u2013 Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Jack Kemp, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden \u2013 some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.\n",

            "msg_body": "The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3\u2013) 5\u20139 (\u201313) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from South east Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine\u2014especially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi. Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals. Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous produc ers in the UK. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5\u2013160 \"seeds\" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. \n",

These 4 Trends Are Making the Risks More Severe.\nSmall neighborhood businesses and Fortune 500s alike are facing increased exposure to harassment and discrimination claims.\nBy: Starr Insurance Companies\nFor many companies these days, the  question is not if you will face an employment-related lawsuit, but when?\nNo matter how much you trust your  employees or managers or how thoroughly you focus on training, it is extremely  rare for a strategy to be 100 percent effective in avoiding claims of  harassment or discrimination.\n\u201cThe probability that a company will  get sued for an alleged employment practices violation has increased  dramatically; aggrieved employees drive some litigation, and, in other cases,  plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers encourage this type of claim,\u201d said Beth Goldberg, chief  underwriting officer, Financial Lines Division, Starr Insurance Companies.  \u201cThese claims can be expensive just to defend, even if they are groundless.\u201d\nAccording to Westlaw, a legal research  service by Thomson Reuters, plaintiffs win 51 percent of the time when  employment practices liability (EPL) claims go to trial.\nLosses from certain types of EPL  lawsuits are also getting larger. Employment law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP found  that settlements for the 10 biggest class actions increased 55 percent from  2016 to 2017.\nThese damages, of course, don\u2019t  reflect the long-term impact to a company\u2019s reputation. For all these reasons,  boards are starting to take notice that, in today\u2019s environment, an EPL  insurance policy is not just \u201cnice to have,\u201d but an absolute necessity.\nFour trends in particular are  currently driving greater EPL exposure:\n1.  It\u2019s not just about lost wages and compensation; juries are increasingly  focused on emotional damages.\n\u201cThe emotional distress and mental  anguish components can be larger than the monetary demand for front pay and  back pay,\u201d Goldberg said.\nAllegations from claimants may range  from discomfort and embarrassment to anxiety and depression. They may claim  that they\u2019ve lost sleep and their health has deteriorated, due to the trauma of  harassment or discrimination. Testimony from family, friends, and treating  psychologists or psychiatrists can buttress these claims and win over a jury.  It can be difficult to place a monetary value on these damages or argue with a  claimant\u2019s demand; determining what\u2019s fair is very subjective.\nSome federal discrimination statutes  place caps on damages that plaintiffs can seek, but they can seek larger  amounts by suing under different federal, state, and local laws that have no  cap.\nIn New Jersey, for example, two  brothers sued their former employer for racial discrimination, hostile work  environment and retaliation under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination  (LAD). The jury awarded them $2.5 million  in damages, including $800,000 in emotional distress damages to one brother,  and $600,000 to the other.\nBeth Goldberg\n                   Chief Underwriting Officer, Financial Lines Division, Starr Insurance Companies\n2.  Social media and movements like #MeToo intensify reputational risk. \nThe \u201cMe Too\u201d movement has brought  national attention to the issue of sexual harassment in and outside of the  workplace. And while \u201cMe Too\u201d has provided a platform for victims to speak  about their experiences and prompted a re-evaluation of what constitutes  appropriate behavior, it has also increased the public profile of claims that  may be false.\n\u201cHarassment has become a headline  risk, one that is magnified by the media and can present an even greater threat  to a company\u2019s reputation,\u201d said Lisa Lockhead, vice president, Head of Private  & Not For Profit \u2013 Financial Lines, Starr Insurance Companies. Thanks to  the power of social media, companies may be prosecuted in the court of public  opinion, before they have a chance to present an argument or defend themselves.  If the story gains enough traction, it could cost an executive his or her job  and it can cost the company its consumers\u2019 trust and loyalty.\n\u201cThis type of reputational damage  can happen even if a story is untrue,\u201d Lockhead said. \u201cThe suggestion of  misconduct may cast a cloud over the company\u2019s brand value, which may translate  into falling stock prices and long-term economic impact.\u201d\n3.  Plaintiffs' attorneys drive class action disability discrimination cases. \nDiscriminatory practices that  violate the Americans with Disabilities Act may similarly garner large settlements  and present reputational risk. Recently, attorneys have sought out such  potential problematic practices in places companies often overlook \u2014 their  company websites.\n\u201cThere has been a growing trend of  plaintiff lawyers going after companies who do not make their websites  accessible to the deaf and blind,\u201d Goldberg said. According to research from  Seyfarth Shaw LLP, plaintiffs filed 4,965 website accessibility lawsuits in the  first half of 2018. At this rate, there will be close to 10,000 such suits by  the end of the year \u2013 a 30 percent increase over 2017.\n\u201cPeople tend to associate  \u2018accessibility\u2019 with physical spaces, but essentially every company has a  website and this digital space is subject to the same oversight,\u201d Goldberg  said.\nPhysical spaces are still, however,  up for grabs. Attorneys in some states are increasingly targeting small retail  shops and corner stores that often lack the space to improve accessibility by  widening doorways or installing ramps. According to a 2017 report by the New  York Post, just five wheelchair-bound New Yorkers are behind almost 400 ADA  lawsuits targeting small businesses across the city.\nEven when store owners are renters,  they can still be held accountable for noncompliance with the ADA. \u201cThe  plaintiff firms are naming both (renters and owners) to go after the deep  pockets,\u201d Lockhead said.\n4.  Varying state regulations add complexity to compliance. \nIn addition to federal regulations,  companies must also contend with variances in state law.\n\"In particular, states vary in their protection of rights afforded to the LGBTQ community. Companies should have an understanding of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and what their obligations are as far as bathroom access, or using non-gendered pronouns, etc. What rights are protected and to what extent?\" Lockhead said.\nDiscrimination based on physical  appearance is also treated differently on a state-by-state basis. California,  for example, expressly bars employers from discriminating based on body type,  while New York does not.\n\u201cState laws go far beyond federal  regulations, and understanding the differences is especially important for  multi-state employers,\u201d Goldberg said.\nIt\u2019s  More Important Than Ever to Ensure Internal Controls Are in Place\nThere are several risk control and risk transfer strategies organizations can deploy to mitigate the EPL losses. Some basic controls are critical, like employee handbooks that detail a code of conduct, policies and procedures around hiring and firing, thorough training, and a dedicated leader of human resources.\nThe ADA published a 27-item checklist to help companies make their websites accessible. Most are easy fixes, such as including text descriptions for links and navigation menus, and HTML alt tags for images for hearing-impaired visitors, or corresponding audio descriptions for the visually-impaired. Sites should also offer a way to contact a web manager with questions or complaints about accessibility.\nThese adjustments are not resource-intensive, even for smaller companies. But companies also need to do an assessment of their corporate culture.\nPart of improving company culture is providing a way for employees to raise concerns without fear of retribution. To that end, \"providing a way for employees to report issues internally directly to the board \u2014anonymously if they wish \u2014 can help get ahead of potential claims. Change has to come from the top down,\" Lockhead said.\nTo learn more, visit www.starrcompanies.com/insurance/employmentpracticeliability. \nThis article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Starr Insurance Companies.

The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal. Three types of sensory memories exist. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information; a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have \n",
