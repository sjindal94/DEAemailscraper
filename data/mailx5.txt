Before today, like many of us, I was scared and anxious about this election season.\nI was horrified to see the largest anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and the anti-Black shooting of two people in a supermarket a couple weeks ago.\nI cried for the asylum seekers, trans and intersex people, and Black and Latinx voters who were put at risk in the name of corporate interests and racists. I was heartbroken that people had to pay this toll for Trump\u2019s \u201cnationalism.\u201d\nAll this to try to win an election.\nSome corporations--like Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s technology for ICE--have actively aided the mission of the far-right. Some have simply not taken an action to defend the things that matter.\nFor those corporations and CEOs, SumOfUs members like you have been holding them to account with petitions and picket signs--acts of love and fury for a more just world.\nBefore today, SumOfUs members chose democracy over corporatocracy and voted in new progressive pathways to corporate accountability across the country.\nWith the support of SumOfUs members like you, we projected a message on Trump\u2019s properties in NYC to shine a light on the corruption that fuels his corporate coup.\nAnd we mobilized thousands of voters in Baltimore to win a ballot measure that makes Baltimore the first major city in the country to ban water privatization. (You can donate here to support more efforts like this.)\nTogether, we demonstrated we can win for people and planet.\nAnd we mobilized to support each other.\nWe came together and raised funds for HIAS, a Jewish organization that helps refugees. They were named by the Pittsburgh shooter as the cause for his deadly attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue.\nSupport HIAS by donating here. \nJewish organizers came together and organized against racism.\nSupport Jews for Racial and Economic Justice here.\nBlack organizers with the Movement for Black Lives came together and rallied people in the name of life and dignity.\nDonate to Movement for Black Lives here.\nTrans and intersex activists organized in the name of the full and total humanity of all people.\nDonate to the Transgender Law Center here.\nDonate to InterACT here.\nDonate to Southerners on New Ground here.\nMigrant groups organized in the name of empathy across borders.\nDonate to Mijente here. \nDonate to United We Dream here. \nWith your efforts and theirs, I felt restored and even more committed to carrying on our task. I hope you do too.\nI want to leave you with a poem from Aurora Levins Morales, reprinted with her permission.\nV'ahavta\nAurora Levins Morales\nSay these words when you lie down and when you rise up,when you go out and when you return. In times of mourningand in times of joy. Inscribe them on your doorposts,embroider them on your garments, tattoo them on your shoulders,teach them to your children, your neighbors, your enemies,recite them in your sleep, here in the cruel shadow of empire:Another world is possible.\nThus spoke the prophet Roque Dalton:All together they have more death than we,but all together, we have more life than they. There is more bloody death in their handsthan we could ever wield, unlesswe lay down our souls to become them,and then we will lose everything. So instead,\nimagine winning. This is your sacred task.This is your power. Imagineevery detail of winning, the exact smell of the summer streetsin which no one has been shot, the muscles you have neverunclenched from worry, gone soft as newborn skin,the sparkling taste of food when we knowthat no one on earth is hungry, that the beggars are fed,that the old man under the bridge and the womanwrapping herself in thin sheets in the back seat of a car,and the children who suck on stones,nest under a flock of roofs that keep multiplying their shelter.Lean with all your being towards that daywhen the poor of the world shake down a rain of good fortuneout of the heavy clouds, and justice rolls down like waters.\nDefend the world in which we win as if it were your child.It is your child.Defend it as if it were your lover.It is your lover.\nWhen you inhale and when you exhalebreathe the possibility of another worldinto the 37.2 trillion cells of your bodyuntil it shines with hope.Then imagine more.\nImagine rape is unimaginable. Imagine war is a scarcely credible rumorThat the crimes of our age, the grotesque inhumanities of greed,the sheer and astounding shamelessness of it, the vast fortunesmade by stealing lives, the horrible normalcy it came to have,is unimaginable to our heirs, the generations of the free.\nDon\u2019t waver. Don\u2019t let despair sink its sharp teethInto the throat with which you sing. Escalate your dreams.Make them burn so fiercely that you can follow them downany dark alleyway of history and not lose your way.Make them burn clear as a starry drinking gourdOver the grim fog of exhaustion, and keep walking.\nHold hands. Share water. Keep imagining.So that we, and the children of our children\u2019s childrenmay live\nAurora Levins Morales is a community supported poet and disabled woman of color, so if the poem moved you, we encourage you to donate to her Patreon or buy a print of the poem.\nThanks for all that you do,  Salma, Sijal, and the team at SumOfUs\nSumOfUs is a community of people from around the world committed to curbing the growing power of corporations. We want to buy from, work for and invest in companies that respect the environment, treat their workers well and respect democracy.

It's a challenging time in our country, and the increase in civic engagement has been reassuring. I know that if we stay engaged, our voices can be a major force for change in D.C.\n\tServing in the majority party is a responsibility I will take very seriously. We have a lot of work to do. The Trump administration must be held accountable for the actions of the executive branch and the House must provide oversight. At the same time, we will be fighting for progress on issues that affect Americans every day - affordable health care for all, quality public education, investing in infrastructure, protecting the environment, and campaign finance reform.\n\tI'm ready for the work. I will be fighting every day for a better future for our families, our state, our country, and our planet.

Add help@TestingMom.com as a contact.\nHi Mike -\u00a0\nI'm hosting a webinar for my friends at Mightier so they can tell you about their breakthrough technology by using games and wearable technology that teaches a child to control his or her emotions. I was so impressed with their team I invited Dr. White to teach you how to build your child's confidence.\nWebinar topic:\u00a0Building a Child's Self Confidence through the Mind-Body Connection\nRegister now for Tuesday, November 13, 2108\u00a0at 9pm ET/8pm CT/7pm MT/6pm PT.\u00a0\nJoin\u00a0Dr. Erina White of Mightier and Boston Children's Hospital for a live webinar on how to build your child's self confidence through his or her mind-body connection.\nWhat you\u2019ll learn at this webinar for parents of kids ages 3 to 14:\nEmotional strength by listening to kids. Emotional strength is a word I\u2019ll use a lot. I like it when kids know about their emotions and how they can turn them into better people. Being able to successfully navigate emotions makes kids stronger.\nSecond, we\u2019re going to talk about what you as a parent can do to turn challenging moments, especially frustrations and anxieties, into brain building moments for your child.\nFinally, we\u2019ll talk about how you, as parents, we can set ourselves up for success by building a team around you.\nRegister now for Tuesday, November 13, 2108\u00a0at 9pm ET/8pm CT/7pm MT/6pm PT.\u00a0\nMightier is video game-based program developed at Harvard Medical School that teaches kids self-regulation to thrive in life. Kids wear a Mighty Band heart rate monitor that visibly changes how the games work. As heart rate goes up the games get more difficult to play. Your child makes connections that when they are angry, frustrated, or upset, the world reacts, so they should too. Kids quickly learn that in order to have success they need to be calm. With enough game practice, the wins pile up and kids start applying skills in life. Mightier supports parents with online communities and coaching.\u00a0\nYour partner in learning,\nKaren Quinn, the Testing Mom\nThis email was sent by: TestingMom.com, 7460 Warren Parkway, Frisco, Texas 75034\nTo unsubscribe, click here.\u00a0\n",

If you want to save up to 38% on any package of Masterclass, now is your chance.\nClaim the Early Bird Price\nI have a few questions for you...\nQuestion #1Do you desire to start a profitable freelance None business that allows you work from home, and have more freedom to enjoy your life?\nQuestion #2Have you tried freelancing before, but you gave up because it simply wasn\u2019t sustainable and the clients undervalued your services\u2026or worse, didn\u2019t want to pay you?\nQuestion #3Are you looking for a way to ensure you\u2019ll have enough freelancing income to eliminate the risk of quitting your job?\nQuestion #4Do you have life commitments (job, kids, school, etc.) that you feel prevent you from dedicating time to making true progress on your freelance business?\nDid you say \u201cyes\u201d to any (or all) of these questions?\nWell, I\u2019ve got good news for you\u2026 Freelancing Freedom Masterclass is a perfect fit for you.\nAnd why is that?\nIf you desire to start a business & be your own boss...\nThis is one of the best ways for you to take back your time, earn an honest living, and enjoy an abundance of freedom. The core training, community & resources in Freelancing Freedom Masterclass is your key to finally launch that business and experience the freedom you deserve.\nIf you\u2019ve tried freelancing before, but gave up...\nOr maybe you\u2019ve considered using those \"freelancing\" websites like UpWork and Fiverr... You just haven\u2019t been looking in the right places (or using the right approach). There is an abundance of high-paying clients out there, but you need to know where to find them, and how to convince them to hire you. The Masterclass shows you exactly how to do that (with only a couple hours of commitment per week)!\nIf you believe freelancing income is too unstable...\nI like to refer to it as \u201cMountains and Valleys\u201d. This cycle forces most new freelancers into submission prematurely... But it doesn't have to be that way! When you implement my \"Income Bridge Technique\", you'll be able to create a more stable (and growing) income and get yourself across those \"valleys\".\nIf you have life commitments holding you back...\nYou're not alone! But if you waited for \u201cthe perfect time\u201d to start your business, you\u2019d never start. Most people are told, \u201cquit your job\u201d in order to live your dream and build an online business. But that\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes you could possibly make! There is a way to build your freelance business on the side, all while maintaining the security of your full-time job (and accommodating a busy schedule). The Masterclass will show you how to uncover up to 40 hours of time in the week you didn\u2019t know you had\u2026 plus, you\u2019ll learn that your first 3 paying clients are in plain sight.\nIf you're considering joining the course, head over to the website to learn more about it.\nAll the best,Brad\np.s. If you have any questions whatsoever, hit reply. We will answer any questions you have ASAP!\np.p.s. Yesterday's webinar was absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe we had over 1,750 people from all over the world register to learn about starting a freelance business!\nI also challenged everyone to copy & paste a script I provided on their Facebook feeds. The script was a simple message that let their personal network know they are launching their freelance business and taking on clients. The crazy part? It worked. At least 5 people who did the challenge got serious interest in their business, some even booked multiple clients on the spot!\nIf you'd like to check out the webinar and do the challenge, we've got another one coming up next Monday. Or you can watch the replay of yesterday's webinar (but hurry, I'm taking it down tonight).\n* * *Not interested in Freelancing Freedom Masterclass?

If you're having any doubt, you can check out our website at https://www.costa.co.uk/ . Our company has always faced serious difficulties when it comes to selling out our products to Americans/Canada because they are always offering to pay with US MONEY ORDERS and US CHECKS which has proved difficult for us to cash here in the UK.
