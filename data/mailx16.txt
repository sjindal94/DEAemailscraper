            "msg_body": "Meat, sometimes labelled protein and occasionally inclusive of legumes and beans, eggs, meat analogues and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides. Examples include chicken, fish, turkey, pork and beef.\nEven More Dream Asian Ladies...\nIn the Avestan literature and Iranian mythology, there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: Amesha Spenta Amordad (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), Gaokerena (or white Haoma, a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), Mashy\u00d0\u00b0 and Mashyane (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), Barsom (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or Haoma that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), Haoma (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc. Gaokerena is a large, sacred Haoma planted by Ahura Mazda. Ahriman (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, Ahura Mazda created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because Ahriman is responsible for all evil including death, while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life). haoma is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities\u2014health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds. Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit soma. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism. Another related issue in ancient mythology of Iran is the myth of Mashy\u00d0\u00b0 and Mashyane, two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the creation myth where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form) \n",

The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes. Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. Yvonne Aitken has shown that flowering transition depends on a number of factors, and that plants flowering earliest under given conditions had the least dependence on climate whereas later-flowering varieties reacted strongly to the climate setup. \n",

The Ecuadorian capital's 16th-century Centro Hist\u00f3rico (Old Town) is not only  the largest and best-preserved colonial center in Latin America, it's also the  world's very first UNESCO World Heritage city.\" --Cond\u00e9  Nast Traveler\n  Dear Overseas Opportunity Letter Reader,\n  \"When are you  going to hold a conference in Ecuador again?\" \nSince I  joined the Events team here at Live and Invest Overseas three years ago, this  has been one of the most frequently asked questions to drop into my mailbag. \nThough our  last Ecuador conference was in 2014 (before my time at the helm of LIOS  events), we never lost interest in Ecuador. But sometimes we have to shuffle  around destinations on our calendar... and some old favorites must retire\u2014at  least temporarily\u2014to make way for new ones. \nNow, I'm  thankful for all those reader requests... and to Overseas Property  Alert Editor Wendy Howarter for helping to bring Ecuador back  into the limelight. \nEarlier this  year, Wendy made a scouting trip around Ecuador's main cities and along the country's  Pacific coast... and found that everything that was great about Ecuador four  years ago is still there today...\nAt our Retire  Overseas Conference last September, Wendy took our audience on a whirlwind tour  of the country\u2014highlighting the best places for expats to consider... and the  pros and cons of living in this Latin American country that's slightly smaller  than Nevada. \nTopping  Wendy's list of places to consider setting up a new home in Ecuador were:\nCotacachi and Otavalo\u2014two neighboring towns (20  minutes apart) north of capital city Quito that have thriving expat populations  and are famous for their leather (Cotacachi) and textile (Otavalo) production.  (Wendy pointed to the bright handmade alpaca scarf she was wearing that  day\u2014which she'd picked up in the Otavalo market for US$3.) You can rent in  these towns for US$400 to US$500 per month, or you could invest in an apartment  of your own for as little as US$45,000.\n Otavalo and Cotacachi both offer great mountain views \nQuito\u2014the  capital city, celebrating 40 years as a UNESCO World Heritage city, with an  historic center and attractive suburbs between the center and the airport  (Wendy's favorite is Cumbay\u00e1). Quito sits at an altitude of 2,850 meters meaning  lots of sun and springlike weather year-round. Rent from US$4 to US$8 per  square meter per month or buy from US$79,000. \nCuenca\u2014also  a UNESCO-protected colonial city with the highest expat population in the  country (between 6,000 and 7,000 expats call Cuenca home). This former Incan  capital also has the most impressive architecture in the country. Average rent  is US$530 per month. Buy from US$150,000. \n Cuenca's iconic Catedral de  la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n\nPacific  Coast\u2014from Atacames in the north to Playas in the south, you have  plenty of options for beach living. Salinas\u2014two hours west of Guayaquil  (Ecuador's biggest city)\u2014is a popular choice along this coast. Salinas is home  to a growing expat community and an ideal spot to wait out the North American  winter.\nAs for the  ups and downs to Ecuadorian living, Wendy shared the following insights...\nEcuador Pros\nNonstop flights to Quito and  Guayaquil from the United States\u2014plus direct flights to Europe... \nSpringlike weather year-round  (without the need for air conditioning, energy bills are low)... \nMedical services are cheap making  pay-as-you-go health care an attractive option. A specialist visit costs US$38,  and a hospital stay costs from US$110 per night for a suite (or from US$60 for  a standard room)... \nAttractive residency options with low  qualification thresholds (retirees need only show an income of US$800 a month;  for an investor visa, you must invest a minimum of US$27,000)... \nLarge and vibrant expat  communities\u2014particularly around Cuenca and Quito... \nHandicrafts make a great export  business opportunity for those looking to make extra income... \nEasy and inexpensive to explore the whole  country (Wendy's driver for her two-hour journey between Salinas and Guayaquil  charged just US$12). \nEcuador Cons\nLack of English spoken  outside of major cities...\nCorruption, dishonesty, and lack of regulation (as in many parts  of Latin America)... \nFor the first two years of residency, you must not leave the  country for more than 90 days. \nThat's just a taste of  what Wendy covered in the limited time slot we gave her in Las Vegas recently...  and a sneak preview of what's to come when we gather our full team of Ecuador experts in  Quito next March.\nEcuador is hands down  the cheapest destination in Latin America where you could live a comfortable  lifestyle... \nBut it's not for  everyone. \nTo get the full  picture\u2014and to decide whether it could be for you... as well as where  specifically you should considering focusing your own search in this country\u2014I  hope you'll join us next March 20\u201322 for our Live and Invest in Ecuador  Conference.\nAs I mentioned, our  schedules haven't permitted us to hold an event in Ecuador for four years. This  is your chance, finally, to come see firsthand what this beautiful country has  to offer.\nValentine Fouch\u00e9\n  Events Director, Live and Invest Overseas\nP.S. We're counting down to  the launch of registration for this special return-to-Ecuador event.\nThe first 40 readers to  sign up to join us in Ecuador next spring will receive a free VIP package that  includes free airport transfers, front-row seating, and concierge service to  help with planning your trip. \nGo here now to register your advance interest and to be  on the hot list to receive first notification when we open registration. \nThis guarantees you the chance to secure your VIP place in  the room.\nTODAY\nAt 11 a.m. Paris time  yesterday, the bells of Notre Dame rang out for 11 minutes to commemorate the  100th anniversary, to the minute, of the armistice ending World War I.\nLief and I, back in Paris  this week, listened from the quay.\nTo mark the ceasefire, 72  world leaders joined French President Emmanuel Macron for a rainy Sunday in  Paris. The group walked together, side by side, down the final stretch of the  Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es to the foot of the Arc de Triomphe for a ceremony remembering  the War To End All Wars...\n         --------------------------------------\nCash In On One Of The Most Consumed Fruits On \nThe Planet\nThis is a unique opportunity to enjoy annualized returns of  18% over 30 years (and beyond) with a one-time investment of only US$39,000.\n  You won't find anything boasting this return and  convenience at this low level of risk anywhere else.\nGo here now to request more details  on this unique opportunity in Panama.\n       --------------------------------------\nMAILBAG\n \"Kathleen, I'm looking to  move to Belize, and I have so many questions. I don't know where to start. Do I  need to exchange money? Do I have to get a visa to visit first? \n\"I am thinking your  conference in January would be a good idea for me, but I can't now find the  email about it. Do you know if there are seats left?\n\"So much more I want to ask  about.\"\n--Peggy J., United States\nWe understand. Moving to a  new country (even one where the language is English, as it is in Belize) is a  daunting proposition... and, yes, for sure, you have many questions to answer  before making the leap.\nI recommend you get started  getting to know Belize better by signing up for our free e-letter on the  country.  You can get your  name on the list for our In Focus: Belize service here.\nThen, yes, our Live and  Invest in Belize Conference taking place in Belize City Jan. 23\u201325 sounds like  a great idea for you.\nThis event will sell out. As  of this writing, I believe only 3 seats remain available in the room.\nGo here for more information. \nOr contact our Events Team  with your questions by phone toll-free from the United States at 1-888-627-8834 or at 1-443-599-1221  from anywhere else in the world.\nHope to see you in Belize in  January.\nMore From Overseas Opportunity Letter...\nThe Sounds Of Home\nBy Kathleen Peddicord Nov. 11, 2018 \nWhat would you like to see from your bedroom window each morning... and what would you like to hear?...\nRead More\nThanks for reading  Overseas Opportunity Letter, a free daily email service brought to you six days a week by Live and Invest Overseas publications.

He points to a 2018 study that showed that after receiving a diagnosis and talking to a cancer specialist who recommended a course of treatment, only 0.02 percent of patients chose alternative medicine exclusively over standard cancer care.Also, doctors might consider encouraging patients interested in complementary care by having a conversation about integrative therapies and pointing them toward the right studies.\u201cI think that sometimes with the cancer diagnosis, the search to look for other treatments beyond what is out there currently may actually be a potential conversation starter \u2014 for physicians to talk to cancer patients about clinical trials, to look at new treatment in a scientific way,\u201d Carrillo said.\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to  new, FDA-approved treatments and therapies to advance the science,\u201d he said. \u201cOne clinical trial at a time.\u201d \n",

We provided that. People wanted a way to interact with us personally. We added that.\u00a0\n This happened, and continued to happen for the past 12 years and what you see TODAY is a collection of 12 years of tireless effort building out our platform (not to mention our amazing team of 25 employees working long hours to keep the WA engine evolving faster than any other platform in the industry).\n Wealthy Affiliate is ALIVE and there has never been a more exciting time to be part of the platform.\u00a0 We have innovations and break-through technologies that are being released weekly at WA and the next year is going to be no different.\u00a0 In fact, it is going to be our most brilliant one yet.\u00a0\n Want to read more, I would love for you to take a second and chime into Kyle's post that walks you through some of the things we have recently released and also \"hints\" as to some things that are going to be coming your way in the future.\u00a0\n ===> JOIN DISCUSSION: A Dozen Years Later, the Future Never Looked So Good\n There has never been a better time to be online.\u00a0 The affiliate marketing and Internet business world is growing at a pace we have never seen in our 12 years in business and the platform and community at WA has never been better.\u00a0\n So to put it in few words, WE ARE AMPED for the future of WA and for YOUR future within the online world.\u00a0\n I truly hope you are making the most of your experience and WA and truly enjoying yourself Lewis! If you get a chance, I would recommend you read that discussion I provided above and feel free to offer your thoughts and feedback. We are not only a transparent community, but one that also thrives on feedback.\u00a0\n It's how we get better after all and the reason that Wealthy Affiliate has become THE place to create and grow a business online!\n To you and your success,\nCarson\nCo-founder of Wealthy Affiliate\nWealthyAffiliate.com\nHosting\nWebsites\nSupport\nTraining\nDomains\n\u00a9 2018 WealthyAffiliate.com\nManage your email preferences\n",

Examples include chicken, fish, turkey, pork and beef.\nEnjoy the Scenery of These Irresistible Ladies\nIn the Avestan literature and Iranian mythology, there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: Amesha Spenta Amordad (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), Gaokerena (or white Haoma, a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), Mashy\u00d0\u00b0 and Mashyane (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), Barsom (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or Haoma that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), Haoma (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc. Gaokerena is a large, sacred Haoma planted by Ahura Mazda. Ahriman (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, Ahura Mazda created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because Ahriman is responsible for all evil including death, while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life). haoma is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities\u2014health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds. Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit soma. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism. Another related issue in ancient mythology of Iran is the myth of Mashy\u00d0\u00b0 and Mashyane, two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the creation myth where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form) \n",

The transition must take place at a time that is favorable for fertilization and the formation of seeds, hence ensuring maximal reproductive success. To meet these needs a plant is able to interpret important endogenous and environmental cues such as changes in levels of plant hormones and seasonable temperature and photoperiod changes. Many perennial and most biennial plants require vernalization to flower. The molecular interpretation of these signals is through the transmission of a complex signal known as florigen, which involves a variety of genes, including CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favorable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. The first step of the transition is the transformation of the vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of the central part of the stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the outside of the stem end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. Yvonne Aitken has shown that flowering transition depends on a number of factors, and that plants flowering earliest under given conditions had the least dependence on climate whereas later-flowering varieties reacted strongly to the climate setup. \n",

This week, it was announced that because of legal impediments, he will not be prosecuted.\nSign on to our letter demanding that Schneiderman donate the millions of dollars from his now defunct re-election campaign to organizations that support survivors and seek to end intimate partner violence. \nAfter initially insisting that the reported hitting, choking, and slapping had been \"consensual,\" Schneiderman recently said he will \"accept full responsibility\" for the abusive behavior and \"for the impact it had\" on the women he harmed.\nWe launched this petition campaign in partnership with the National Organization for Women (NOW) and NOW-New York to ensure that Schneiderman turns his words of contrition into action.\nSign on to the letter demanding that Schneiderman donate funds from his defunct re-election campaign to organizations that center the voices, needs, and concerns of all survivors.\nFor Women's Lives,\nEleanor Smeal\nPresident\nYou have received this e-mail because of your interest in women's issues.

Keeping the railing monochromatic in a color that complements the rest of the house's paint and trim creates a clean look. If you want to add some variety, use a secondary shade in the same color family and apply it to the main posts or the spindles.\nCreate DIY Doormats\nAn affordable and unique way to create a \"wow\" moment at your home\u2019s entry is to craft a DIY doormat with spray paint. A chevron pattern is an easy way to make a statement by simply using painter's tape and two different colors of spray paint.  \nPut the Spotlight on Light Fixtures\nSmall splashes of color can go a long way, especially with a feature like exterior light fixtures. For light fixtures to stand out against a neutral-colored home, try spray painting them a bold hue, such as bright yellow, for a burst of color.   \nRefresh Patio Furniture\nOver time, patio furniture loses its luster. If it's still in good shape, you can bring it back to life with a fresh coat of spray paint. All the angles can make it difficult to cover every surface, so choose a product that promotes easy application. Remember to tilt furniture back and apply color to the feet and legs for an all-over finish that's ready to weather the season.\nFall Home Considerations to Make Before Winter\nIt\u2019s that time of year again. The fall season is winding down and we\u2019re about to hit the thick of winter. Are you ready to stay warm and cozy, or does your home need a once over to be prepared? A final run at refreshing your living space before winter can pay real dividends. Here are a few ideas.\nSafety first. Did you know that three in five home fire deaths are the result of fires in homes without smoke alarms, or with no working smoke alarms? Oftentimes, this is due to intentional device deactivation. Instead of getting frustrated at your beeping alarm, make sure the batteries are working now or install new alarms where needed. You should have a smoke alarm on every floor of your house, and in every bedroom.\nStay warm. Is your furnace in working order? You don\u2019t want to find out the answer to that question when the temperature really drops. A maintenance appointment from a certified technician should cost about $80-$100 and will ensure that everything is functioning and that your furnace will be operating efficiently. The tech should also measure to see if there\u2019s any carbon-monoxide leakage from your furnace.\nStop the leaks. Drafty doors and windows are not only a huge annoyance, they\u2019re costly. Why pay all that money to just let the heat escape? You can find problem areas by running your hands close to windows and trying to feel a breeze. Use a quality silicon caulk or weather stripping to seal up any leaks. And if you notice a draft on an exterior door, consider installing a door sweep.\nQUESTIONS?
