            "msg_body": "In 2008 I had just taken over as the lead service technician for a BAS service group in Seattle. The economy was in a downturn and there was very little work to be had. \nYet despite this I was able to close almost 1 million dollars in retrofit work as a service technician. How did this happen?\n1 year prior to this role I worked as a BAS construction technician. In this role I got exposed to dozens of projects and learned exactly what parts and pieces made up a job and more importantly what parts didn't need to be in the estimate. \nHere are just two of the things I learned from this time working in construction:\n1) Sometimes you can get away with doing less than the specification says. I remember a project that required 1k Platinum sensors using 4 to 20 mA for ever temperature sensor. This was a massive job and the cost to switch between 1k ohm 2 wire vs 4 to 20 mA saved a good amount. Sure it was a risk but we knew what would be value engineered out of the job.\n2) If you can understand the intent you can often get creative with the design. One time I bypassed an entire set of controllers and pulled the information I needed directly from the BACnet cards on the chillers and rooftop units. This made my project way less than the estimated cost.\nThis knowledge around scoping and estimating tasks enabled me to out compete other companies who weren't creatively scoping and estimating their jobs.\nNow, this was early on in my career.\n Before I knew about specification influence. Before I had ever heard the phrase \"taking exception to the spec\". \nBut as I started to learn more about how to estimate and scope projects I saw an interesting pattern. The more I learned the more I succeeded in my career. The skill of scoping and estimating projects had more effect on my career than any other skill.\nBut there is a problem.\nThese days very few people are passing down the art and science of scoping and estimating projects. \nThat's why we are creating our new course BAS Scoping and Estimating. \nBAS Scoping and Estimating exists to teach BAS professionals how to Scope and Estimate BAS Projects. If you are an estimator, sales professionals, consulting engineer or simply someone who wants to better understand the scoping and estimating process then this course is for you.\nAnd the best part is that the beta for BAS Scoping and Estimating is open now. It's a win-win-win. You get to provide feedback on what you need to learn in the course as we create it. You get access to the course material before anyone else. And you get 50% off the retail cost of the course.\nBut...\nThere are only 67 slots left in BAS Scoping and Estimating. And tomorrow I am opening enrollment to the public. \nAct now, and change your BAS career forever. Click here to enroll in the beta.\nTo your success, \n-Phil\nP.S.

The use of jazz double bass method books by electric bass players in jazz is facilitated in that jazz methods tend to emphasize improvisation techniques (e.g., how to improvise walking basslines) and rhythmic exercises rather than specific ways of holding or plucking the instrument. Formal training Of all of the genres, jazz and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, R&B, etc.) have the most established and comprehensive systems of instruction and training for electric bass. In the jazz scene, teens can begin taking private lessons on the instrument and performing in amateur big bands at high schools or run by the community. Young adults who aspire to be come professional jazz bassists or studio rock bassists can continue their studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges and some universities. Several colleges offer electric bass training in the US. The Bass Institute of Technology (BIT) in Los Angeles was founded in 1978, as part of the Musician's Institute. Chuck Rainey (electric bassist for Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye) was BIT's first director. BIT was one of the earliest professional training program for electric bassists. The program teaches a range of modern styles, including funk, rock, jazz, Latin, and R&B. The Berklee College of Music in Boston offers training for electric bass players. Electric bass students get private lessons and there is a choice of over 270 ensembles to play in. Specific electric bass courses include funk/fusion styles for bass; slap techniques for electric bass; fingerstyle R&B; five- and six-string electric bass playing (including performing chords); and how to read bass sheet music. Berklee College alumni include Jeff Andrews, Victor Bailey, Jeff Berlin, Michael Manring, and Neil Stubenhaus. The Bass Department has two rooms with bass amps for classes and ten private lesson studios equipped with audio recording gear. Berklee offers instruction for the four-, five-, and six-string electric bass, the fretless bass, and double bass. \"Students learn concepts in Latin, funk, Motown, and hip-hop, ... jazz, rock, and fusion.\" In Canada, the Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning offers an Advanced Diploma (a three-year program) in jazz and commercial music. The program accepts performers who play bass, guitar, keyboard, drums, melody instruments (e.g., saxophone, flute, violin) and who sing. Students get private lessons and perform in 40 student ensembles. The Manhattan School of Music, at the intersection of West 122nd Street (Seminary Row) and Broadway \n",

Your spine has a shelf life.\nYou only have so many flexions in your spine before it starts to deteriorate.\nYou can't repair it. You can't change it.

Photo: Katie Conner\nVirginia Department of Forestry\n Autumn took its time arriving this year, but there\u2019s no doubt of the season now.  The highest mountain areas are beginning to brown and lose their leaves, thanks in part to recent rains.   But many mountain areas below 3000 feet are at peak color this weekend, including much of the Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah Valley.   The Piedmont also offers colorful viewing this weekend.  Red and sugar maples are waving bright flags of orange, pink and red, while hickories have melted into clear golden yellows.  Interspersed with the green of pines, these trees create blocks of color that rival a crazy quilt.   Don\u2019t forget, oaks tend to color later, and their best hues are still to come. \n Learn More \u2192\nSkyline Drive, November 6, 2018.

But that is what cryptocurrencies are... assets. \nAnd assets put money IN your pockets. So\u2026 yeah. Better learn about crypto.\nWhen I talk with Jeff Wang \u2013 the smartest crypto guy I know \u2013 he says \nCrypto is...\nWhat the airplane was in the 1930\u2019s \nWhat Rock-n-roll was in the 1950\u2019s\nWhat the internet was in the 1980\u2019s \nWhat the smart phone was in the 2000\u2019s \nIn other words, crypto is one the biggest, most innovative movements we may ever see in our lifetime. And that\u2019s simply because... \nCrypto is going to change MONEY!\nSo, what do you think? Should you take the time and energy to learn about something that is changing money? And in changing money, changes our whole life, society and culture?\nImagine what will happen if you don\u2019t? You could lose everything you\u2019ve been working for.\nNow imagine you do learn. You are lucky to be alive because you are at the birth of a new asset class. That\u2019s like being alive at the Big Bang or creation\u2026 the birth of gold.\nThe problem is the media is not honest about it... or ignorant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe asset is new so it is growing daily. And as it grows it changes and morphs and spiders in so many directions. You can\u2019t use the news to keep you informed. That\u2019s why I use Jeff Wang.\nCrypto currencies are the secret weapon on front lines of the currency wars.\nRich Dad Editor: \nTo know the truth and not get caught up in the hype.
