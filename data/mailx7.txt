The broker continues to believe the reports contained a number of inaccuracies and are unfounded. The broker retains forecasts and expects strong earnings growth. Morgans believes the stock has been severely oversold, which provides the opportunity to buy a company with solid long-term growth potential. Rating is upgraded to Add from Hold. Target is raised to $26.72 from $23.30.    Target price is $26.72 Current Price is $22.95  Difference: $3.77 If CTD meets the Morgans target it will return approximately     16% (excluding dividends, fees and charges). Current consensus price target is $28.14, suggesting upside of 22.6%(ex-dividends)The company's fiscal year ends in June. Forecast for FY19:Morgans forecasts a full year FY19 dividend of 45.00 cents and EPS of 94.00 cents .At the last closing share price the estimated dividend yield is 1.96%. At the last closing share price the stock's estimated Price to Earnings Ratio (PER) is 24.41. How do these forecasts compare to market consensus projections?Current consensus EPS estimate is 94.6, implying annual growth of 30.7%.Current consensus DPS estimate is 46.2, implying a prospective dividend yield of 2.0%.Current consensus EPS estimate suggests the PER is 24.3.Forecast for FY20:Morgans forecasts a full year FY20 dividend of 53.00 cents and EPS of 109.00 cents .At the last closing share price the estimated dividend yield is 2.31%.

Now the broker sees this as more difficult as the challenges from lower housing activity make it harder for the company to predict volume growth. Margin expectations have been cut. James Hardie previously thought input cost pressures would ease but now the opposite appears top be the case. In a declining market with rising cost pressures, the broker expects the share price to languish but retains Buy on a longer term view. Target falls to $22.00 from $24.40.    Target price is $22.00 Current Price is $16.90  Difference: $5.1 If JHX meets the UBS target it will return approximately     30% (excluding dividends, fees and charges).

The company expects market conditions will not improve in the short term and listings may be weaker in the lead up to the NSW election in March. Industry view is Attractive.

One of his most famous sayings is: \"Truth comes out in wine.\"\nDid he know about elderberry wine? Being a naturalist (and Roman), there's a good chance he did. After all, the health benefits of elderberry syrup for treating the symptoms of the flu have been anecdotally cited since before his time.\n\t\tSpecial: Thinning Hair? Pour This on Your Head and Watch What Happens\nBut it's only in the last 20 years that the medicinal properties of the elderberry have been scientifically documented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA small study published in 1998 showed that 93 percent of flu patients given elderberry syrup (Sambucol) were completely symptom-free within two days, while those taking a placebo recovered in about six days.\n           Another controlled study from 1999-2000 in Norway reported that flu patients taking three teaspoons of elderberry syrup four times a day saw their symptoms improve four days earlier than others who took a placebo.\n           And a randomized, double-blind trial in 2009 found that 48 hours after flu sufferers took elderberry extract, 28 percent of them were devoid of all flu symptoms and 60 percent showed some symptom relief. Not a single patient in the placebo control group showed any relief.\nElderberries are more bitter than blackberries or raspberries, which is why they're distilled into wines or baked in pies in combination with other berries.\nBut the concentrated syrup is what you want if you have flu symptoms. As the American Nutrition Association states, \"Elderberry extract seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza.\"\nSponsor \nPowerwash For Your Insides    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat if you could restore your gut health with one simple fix?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to one doctor in California there may be a way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, he believes it\u2019s so powerful that it could be like a \u201cpower wash\u201d for your insides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Gundry, who is a world-renowned heart surgeon, reveals the  root cause of weight gain, food cravings, and low energy in a short video he released to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.S.

On June 6, 2007, one of the operators\"AKOKO   GOLDFIELD LIMITED\" made a numbered time(fixed) deposit for Thirty six calendar   months, valued at USD$3,200,000.00(Three million two hundred thousand dollars)   in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded   address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder,& finally, we  discovered from \"AKOKO GOLDFIELD LIMITED\" contract employee that He passed   on as a result of a heart attack. On further investigation, I found out that   he did not leave a WILL & all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.

            "msg_body": "Hey there,\nI\u2019m happy to announce not one, but two new courses on Educative this week.\nC is enjoying a resurgence in popularity, especially in this day and age of embedded devices and autonomous driving technology. Similarly, \u201cfunctional programming\u201d is a hot topic in the JavaScript community. It\u2019s a new, highly valuable approach to writing code.\nStay on top of two big trending topics with these new courses:\nC Programming: Program Your Way Into C ($29): Despite being one of the simplest and oldest programming languages, C is more relevant than ever. Most of the devices around you -- and the latest autonomous driving technology in the works -- are all powered by C. As a lower-level language, C gives you a deeper understanding of how machines work, and a feel for more abstracted programming languages like Java and Python. Master C, increase your value on the job market, and get a more well-rounded understanding of programming, in this new interactive course. \nFunctional Programming Patterns With RamdaJS (FREE): Functional programming is becoming a popular topic with JavaScript programmers. Learn why FP is a highly valuable approach to writing code, using the RamdaJS library. Improve your data manipulation logic without category theory or new types. You\u2019ll need a good understanding of JS, and experience building a modern web app under your belt -- but if this is you, you\u2019ll enjoy this course.\nI hope you enjoy these two courses, and am happy to hear any feedback!\nHappy learning.\n-- Fahim\nCEO & co-founder, educative.io \n1203 114th Ave SE, \nBellevue, WA 98004\nWant to unsubscribe?

The broker continues to believe the reports contained a number of inaccuracies and are unfounded. The broker retains forecasts and expects strong earnings growth. Morgans believes the stock has been severely oversold, which provides the opportunity to buy a company with solid long-term growth potential. Rating is upgraded to Add from Hold. Target is raised to $26.72 from $23.30.    Target price is $26.72 Current Price is $22.95  Difference: $3.77 If CTD meets the Morgans target it will return approximately     16% (excluding dividends, fees and charges). Current consensus price target is $28.14, suggesting upside of 22.6%(ex-dividends)The company's fiscal year ends in June. Forecast for FY19:Morgans forecasts a full year FY19 dividend of 45.00 cents and EPS of 94.00 cents .At the last closing share price the estimated dividend yield is 1.96%. At the last closing share price the stock's estimated Price to Earnings Ratio (PER) is 24.41. How do these forecasts compare to market consensus projections?Current consensus EPS estimate is 94.6, implying annual growth of 30.7%.Current consensus DPS estimate is 46.2, implying a prospective dividend yield of 2.0%.Current consensus EPS estimate suggests the PER is 24.3.Forecast for FY20:Morgans forecasts a full year FY20 dividend of 53.00 cents and EPS of 109.00 cents .At the last closing share price the estimated dividend yield is 2.31%.

Now the broker sees this as more difficult as the challenges from lower housing activity make it harder for the company to predict volume growth. Margin expectations have been cut. James Hardie previously thought input cost pressures would ease but now the opposite appears top be the case. In a declining market with rising cost pressures, the broker expects the share price to languish but retains Buy on a longer term view. Target falls to $22.00 from $24.40.    Target price is $22.00 Current Price is $16.90  Difference: $5.1 If JHX meets the UBS target it will return approximately     30% (excluding dividends, fees and charges).

One of his most famous sayings is: \"Truth comes out in wine.\"\nDid he know about elderberry wine? Being a naturalist (and Roman), there's a good chance he did. After all, the health benefits of elderberry syrup for treating the symptoms of the flu have been anecdotally cited since before his time.\n\t\tSpecial: Thinning Hair? Pour This on Your Head and Watch What Happens\nBut it's only in the last 20 years that the medicinal properties of the elderberry have been scientifically documented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA small study published in 1998 showed that 93 percent of flu patients given elderberry syrup (Sambucol) were completely symptom-free within two days, while those taking a placebo recovered in about six days.\n           Another controlled study from 1999-2000 in Norway reported that flu patients taking three teaspoons of elderberry syrup four times a day saw their symptoms improve four days earlier than others who took a placebo.\n           And a randomized, double-blind trial in 2009 found that 48 hours after flu sufferers took elderberry extract, 28 percent of them were devoid of all flu symptoms and 60 percent showed some symptom relief. Not a single patient in the placebo control group showed any relief.\nElderberries are more bitter than blackberries or raspberries, which is why they're distilled into wines or baked in pies in combination with other berries.\nBut the concentrated syrup is what you want if you have flu symptoms. As the American Nutrition Association states, \"Elderberry extract seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza.\"\nSponsor \nPowerwash For Your Insides    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat if you could restore your gut health with one simple fix?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to one doctor in California there may be a way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, he believes it\u2019s so powerful that it could be like a \u201cpower wash\u201d for your insides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Gundry, who is a world-renowned heart surgeon, reveals the  root cause of weight gain, food cravings, and low energy in a short video he released to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.S.

My thoughts go out to the community there and, in particular, to the faculty, staff and students at our sister institution California State University\n Channel Islands.\nTragedies such as these can cause a great deal of sadness and anxiety, even for those not directly affected. Add that to the stress of closing out the semester, and life can sometimes feel overwhelming. Self-care is essential, so please make sure to take the\n time you need to be your best. If you need additional support, the professionals in our\nCounseling Center can help. You can visit them in Tivoli 651 or call 303-615-9988. After-hours mental-health support is also available by phone at\u00a0303-615-9911.\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t emphasize that my top priority is keeping our community safe. But I also need your help. Please make sure your contact information is updated in Banner so that you receive messages from our Emergency Alert System. And if you witness\n a situation that seems unusual or suspicious, don\u2019t hesitate to alert the Auraria Police Department. Call 303-556-5000 or text a tip to 720-593-TIPS (8477).\nTo the community of Thousand Oaks and our colleagues at CSU Channel Islands, please know that the MSU Denver family stands with you during this difficult time.\nSincerely,\nJanine Davidson, Ph.D.\nPresident\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Metropolitan State University of Denver\nP.O.

            "msg_body": "And let's make it a reality!\nHey there lovely!\nThink back for a moment. Why did you launch your own coaching or consulting business? \nYou probably had visions of working with amazing clients.. Working when you feel most energised.. wherever you like.. \nAnd earning more money than you did as an employee. \nOh, and having more freedom, too! ;-) \nBut once we get into the business, this visualisation starts to change, doesn\u2019t it? \nWe seem to have one or two of these things, but certainly not them all..\nBut lovely, can I tell you a secret? You can have it all.. both the money and the business! \nAnd I\u2019m not just talking about the extra hour a day.. or another week\u2019s holiday.. that as an employee, would probably satisfy us.\nI mean, living a life where you have the luxury to.. \nWork when you want..\nRelax when you feel like it..\nTo travel..\nTo spend extra time with your family.. \nBut this doesn\u2019t just happen overnight ;-) It didn\u2019t for me. \nI didn\u2019t go from feeling horribly trapped, to flying interstate for a few nights of R&R, and all while doing this WITHOUT the guilt! \nSo.. how did I get from a) trapped.. to b) pampering myself (and yep, on weekdays!)\nThree words.. The Freedom Metric. \nEvery business has one.. and when you know it, you can use it to help navigate through the tough times of your business.. and into freedom! \nYou can have both lifestyle AND profit in your business as a female entrepreneur in 2018. \nI\u2019m proof! ;-) \nI used to daydream about a house in the Adelaide Hills or travelling to Europe but it was always \u2018someday\u2019. \nSomeday, I will do this.. \nSomeday, I will get that.. \nI made someday today. And I based it around this metric. \nAnd, for a coach or consultant, it\u2019s not simply selling a low-ticket online course and watching the sales come in. Because guess what? You\u2019re still not charging enough.\nThe cycle continues..\nI know you\u2019re better than this, lovely! :-) \nAnd with your Freedom Metric keeping you accountable to your lifestyle / profit dream, you\u2019ll be joining me soon. \nSooner than you think.. \nJust for a moment, drop any societal norms or expectations on how you SHOULD be running your business.. or living your life! \nAm I right? I know you hear me, ladies! \nIn my new book, The Doer\u2019s Guide to Coaching & Consulting, I take you through..\nThe issues I see with today\u2019s female entrepreneurs.. and how you can use this winning metric to create freedom in your business (and life). \nThere\u2019s a LOT of strategies in here lovely, so it\u2019s time to start re-visiting that \u2018someday, when I have time\u2019 list ;-) \nI wrote it exclusively for coaches, consultants, and professional service businesses. \nClick here now to get your copy of The Doer\u2019s Guide to Coaching & Consulting. It\u2019s only $9.95 USD, so no excuses, hehe :-) \nPull out your favourite bottle of bubbly and start living your \u2018lifestyle\u2019 now. Because it\u2019s going to happen..\nSoon, lovely lady! \nGrace \nx \nUnsubscribe\nThe Doing Academy 2/43-45 North Steyne, Manly, New South Wales 2095 Australia 1800139998\n",

The compass inside you that already KNOWS your path and your direction.\nFollowing your joy and your passion is the clearest indicator I know for achieving success in life. \nBut admittedly it does sometimes feel scary. Just like when you trust your mental alarm clock to get you up in time for an important meeting.\nBut then all you really need to do each day is to take one step forward\u2026\nIn fact, every great journey in history was made up of consistent, regular steps forward.\nAnd of course some days are a bit special. And you\u2019ll take great leaps and bounds on those days. \nLet\u2019s face it, if you ever take a wrong turn, it\u2019s easy to side step and get back on track.\nIn fact, the laws of physics prove that it\u2019s MUCH easier to change direction if you\u2019re already moving.\nStanding still is never an option!\nThe true rewards in life always come from assessing your strengths\u2026your passions\u2026and your ideas\u2026\nAnd turning THOSE raw gems into consistent, profitable and joyful actions.\nSo the only question is, which step forward will you take today?\nBecause then you can go take it. And the world is yours. It\u2019s so important for you to shine and do your best work. Because then you make the world a better and richer place for all of us.\nGood luck and warmest wishes\nEd Lester\nIf you no longer wish to receive these messages, you can simply unsubscribe using the links below.

This is a victory for our communities, but the fight is far from over. \nThe main thing to know right now is that: If you are a DACA recipient, you can still apply to renew your DACA. And if your DACA expires before 2020, you should renew now. \n    Right now, our priority must be ensuring DACA recipients have the financial resources and the information to renew their applications while we fight to pass permanent protections for undocumented immigrants. But we cannot do it alone and we need your help:\nCan you add a donation to the DACA Renewal Fund to support young immigrants who are attempting to renew their DACA status? We\u2019ve already helped more than 3,000 recipients pay for their application fees, but there are still thousands more who need our support.\nCONTRIBUTE\n    This has been a week of victory for our United We Dream team across the board, but we cannot stop \u2014 not until we defeat President Trump\u2019s immoral assault on our immigrant communities. \n    Let\u2019s get to work.\n    \u2014 Nestor and the rest of the team at United We Dream\nCONTRIBUTE\n                                Sent via ActionNetwork.org.\n                                  To update your email address, change your name or address, or to stop receiving emails from United We Dream, please click here.\n",

Home alone, I'm easily  distracted.\n\"Plus,\" Adrian continued, \"I  appreciate and really benefit from the social aspects of co-sharing workspace.  In every country where I've worked, I've found that the communities I've been  able to access through shared workspaces have been one of the most important  and valuable parts of the experience.\n\"And, today,\" Adrian added,  \"you can customize your strategy. You could work sometimes from home and  sometimes in a shared environment.\"\n\"That's what suits me best,\"  Sam interjected.\nSam is a professional  vlogger, making videos to help promote real estate investment opportunities  across Colombia.\n\"I spend part of my time  touring around the country on my motorcycle, shooting clips for my vlogs,\" Sam  explained. \"Then, back home in Medell\u00edn, I work both from my apartment and from  a rented desk in a shared workspace.\n\"When I'm hard-core into  editing one of my vlogs, I need complete quiet,\" Sam continued. \n\"But then, when I'm finished  one vlogging project and creating a plan for the next one, I appreciate  interaction. I want to be among others living the same kind of lifestyle I am.  They help me... and I like to think that I help them, too.\"\nAdrian and Sam laid out four  things to consider when thinking through how a shared workspace could make  sense as part of your new life making money overseas...\n#1: What  balance of alone time versus time as part of a community will best support both  your moneymaking strategy and your personal approach to work?\n#2: Will it  be worth investing in office space of your own? If not (the answer is probably  no for most digital nomads and expat entrepreneurs), what kind of co-working  space would suit you best?\nShared workspaces today offer  the options of:\nWhat's referred to as a \"hot desk,\"  which means you use any desk available when you show up to work...\nA fixed desk, which is a desk  reserved for you so you have the same workspace every time you show up...\nPrivate office, so you can have your  own space but be able to step outside it to interact with your fellow  shared-space workers.\n#3: Would a  membership in a workspace with locations around the world make sense for you...  or should you instead pay daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly to use a specific  space in the city where you're based?\n#4: How much  community are you looking for? Some co-sharing spaces offer events and  networking opportunities intended to help you interact with your fellow  workers.\nBudget, of course, is another  factor.\n\"On average,\" Adrian  explained, \"you can expect to spend the local equivalent of two cups of coffee  for a day's use of a co-workspace.\"\nHowever, not all co-workspaces  are created equal. Adrian and Sam introduced the group to four shared-space  options that give a good idea of the choices available:\n#1: WeWork, Global\nWeWork offers a global  network of facilities in great locations around the world. The settings are  professional and allow for privacy. Prices are low, and terms of use are  flexible.\n#2: Regus, Global\nRegus facilities are in great  buildings and great locations. They qualify as affordable high-end.\nAs part of the Regus network,  you have access to extensive global connections and can opt to include (and pay  for) admin support... or not.\n#3: Selina, Latin America\nSelina is a Latin  America-specific option and is as much about community and lifestyle as about  work productivity. Selina offers the option of on-site accommodation and provides  travel and wellness support services.\n#4: Hudbud, Bali\nHudbud has been named among  the top 10 co-working spaces in the world by Forbes and others. This is one of  the highest-end options and, like Selina, offers on-site accommodation. Hudbud  also sponsors retreats and special events for members.\nKathleen Peddicord\nP.S. If you could live anywhere, where would you most like to  go?\nAnd, once there, how would you ideally like to spend your time and make your  money?\nWith the help of the real-life expat entrepreneurs, digital nomads, and  cash-flowing retirees from around the world who convened with us in Las Vegas  last week, we worked hard to help every Live and Invest Overseas reader in the  room with us formulate customized answers to those questions.\nIf you missed out on this special Make Money Overseas Event, don't worry.

            "msg_body": "Dear Martin,\nThis year, the Feminist Majority endorsed its largest field of U.S. House candidates since its founding in 1987\u201492 new House candidates (67 women and 25 men) and 91 incumbent House candidates. In the House races, all of our endorsed incumbents won and as many as 34 of our endorsed new women candidates and 16 of our endorsed new men candidates won, contributing to the 116th Congress\u2019s Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.  All of the candidates we endorsed support access to abortion and birth control as well as equality for women, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, healthcare access, education equity, and economic justice.\nThe newly elected Democratic women make up over 60% of the Democratic gains. They are a very diverse group including the 2016 Teacher of the Year, a former military helicopter pilot, a former CIA officer, veterans, small business owners, non-profit organization leaders, social workers, lawyers, health care workers, public servants, and state legislators.  They include African Americans and Latinas, the first two Native American women, the first two Muslim women, and the youngest women ever to be elected to Congress.  \nOn the Senate side, nine Feminist Majority endorsed women incumbents were re-elected while two were defeated.  We were also proud to endorse new candidates Jacky Rosen, who won in Nevada, and Kyrsten Sinema, who was in the too-close-to-call Arizona race that will not be decided for several more days.\nThe Feminist Majority\u2019s Students Vote, Students Win independent expenditure campaign was determined to increase the feminist vote among young people, hiring some 200 campus organizers to rally students to the polls. Those organizers recruited over 2000 volunteers working on campuses in Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Dakota to get out the youth feminist vote.\nYoung voters nationwide turned out in record numbers, favoring Democrats by an overwhelming 2 to 1 margin, according to exit polls.  Turnout rates for 18-29 year olds hit 31% in 2018 up from 21% in 2014, according to data from CIRCLE.\nIn Nevada, turnout among 18-29 year olds in 2018 was estimated at twice the turnout in 2014, according to the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School of Government.  Turnout was even higher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas  and the University of Nevada, Reno where Feminist Majority organizers worked to mobilize student voters.  UNLV turnout was 120% the rate from 2014 and at UNR, turnout was more than 300% what it was in 2014, according to NextGen.\nLines of college students waiting to vote were so long at Arizona State University that the Feminist Majority protested and worked with election lawyers to double the number of voting stations in the late afternoon.  Even with the additional stations, the final students at ASU could not vote until more than 2 and \u00bd hours after the polls closed.\nAt the statewide level the Feminist Majority endorsed women candidates for governor who won in Maine, Kansas, Michigan, Rhode Island, Oregon, and New Mexico, with a possibility of a recount and victory in Georgia.  The women Democratic gubernatorial wins represent a historic breakthrough.\nIn 1987 when the Feminist Majority began, women comprised 5% of Congress.  In 1992, after five years of our Feminization of Power campaign and the Year of Women, women comprised 10% of Congress.  With the midterm elections of 2018, women will comprise 23% of the Members of Congress with over 100 women in the House and 23 women in the Senate.  There is still a long way to go to equality but with determination we will get there at a faster and faster rate with more diversity and more feminist women and men.\nFor Women's Lives,\nEleanor Smeal\nPresident\nYou have received this e-mail because of your interest in women's issues.

I couldn\u2019t be more thankful and proud of this grassroots team who fought back and made their voices heard.But Martin, the fight is not over yet.\n\tDemocrat Stacey Abrams\u2019 campaign for Governor of Georgia still needs our help \u2013 possibly more so than ever before. Her opponent, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, used the power of his office to suppress voters \u2013 especially in communities of color \u2013 and tilt the odds in favor of his own campaign. And now, he\u2019s declaring victory before all the ballots are counted.\n\tLet\u2019s just be clear: this race is so close that it\u2019s within one point of requiring a second runoff election between Kemp and Abrams on December 4. And Brian Kemp will do everything he can to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.This is outright corruption, Martin. But it might just pay off \u2013 unless people all across the country stand with Stacey Abrams and the people of Georgia and fight back.Stacey\u2019s campaign and legal team are still hard at work fighting to make sure every ballot is counted, but they can\u2019t do that without the support of a grassroots team. Will you chip in $3 \u2013 or whatever you can afford \u2013 to support the Abrams campaign and fight back against Brian Kemp\u2019s corruption?\n\tStacey Abrams is INCREDIBLE. She\u2019s been fighting for working people in Georgia her whole life. And despite all the odds being stacked against her, Stacey has outperformed every statewide Democratic candidate in Georgia in decades.\n\tMake no mistake: Brian Kemp used his role as elections referee to suppress voters and boost his chances as candidate for Governor.\n\tThat is not how democracy is supposed to work, Martin. But it\u2019s not over. Stacey Abrams isn\u2019t giving up, and neither can we.Stacey and her staff are working day and night to ensure every ballot is counted, but they can\u2019t keep the lights on without the support of a strong grassroots army.Chip in $3 \u2013 or whatever you can afford \u2013 to support Stacey Abrams\u2019 fight to have every ballot counted in Georgia.\n\tThanks for being a part of this,\n\tElizabeth\nDONATE NOW\nPaid for by Elizabeth for MA\nSenator Warren is only soliciting donations of up to $2,700 per election from individuals and other federally permissible sources.

Similarly, \u201cfunctional programming\u201d is a hot topic in the JavaScript community. It\u2019s a new, highly valuable approach to writing code.\nStay on top of two big trending topics with these new courses:\nC Programming: Program Your Way Into C ($29): Despite being one of the simplest and oldest programming languages, C is more relevant than ever. Most of the devices around you -- and the latest autonomous driving technology in the works -- are all powered by C. As a lower-level language, C gives you a deeper understanding of how machines work, and a feel for more abstracted programming languages like Java and Python. Master C, increase your value on the job market, and get a more well-rounded understanding of programming, in this new interactive course. \nFunctional Programming Patterns With RamdaJS (FREE): Functional programming is becoming a popular topic with JavaScript programmers. Learn why FP is a highly valuable approach to writing code, using the RamdaJS library. Improve your data manipulation logic without category theory or new types. You\u2019ll need a good understanding of JS, and experience building a modern web app under your belt -- but if this is you, you\u2019ll enjoy this course.\nI hope you enjoy these two courses, and am happy to hear any feedback!\nHappy learning.\n-- Fahim\nCEO & co-founder, educative.io \n1203 114th Ave SE, \nBellevue, WA 98004\nWant to unsubscribe?

I can always tell when your question begins with something like, \"I've been browsing the site for a while, and I have this question before I really get started...\"\nFirst of all, if you've been browsing for a while, you've had more than enough time to get acclimated.  You've also had more than enough time to find a girl who caught your fancy - Otherwise you wouldn't keep coming back. \nSo what is it that causes such hesitation?\nAre you new, or nervous?  Perhaps you're unsure if sugar dating is \"for real.\"  Well, believe it, buddy - Although it can seem like it's too good to be true, there are a wide variety of girls in your area that are looking to date you,and become your no-strings-attached companion, just so long as you keep their particular needs met.  It's a tradition that goes back hundreds (if not thousands) of years for a reason.\nAre you worried about making a mistake, or saying the wrong thing?  I understand (especially if you're new) the need to be conscious of etiquette, and the paranoia of looking like a fool or a creep.  Don't worry - The women on the site are just people, looking for a connection the same as you.\u00a0 You can avoid embarrassment (and come off looking like the \"perfect gentleman\" that sugar babies crave) simply by being polite and treating her with respect.\nPerhaps you are unsure whether you could afford to become a sugar daddy.  Without knowing the particulars, it's difficult for me to tell you that you're wrong about that.  I will say, however, that there I believe there truly is someone for everyone, and you never know whether a woman on the site would be satisfied with what you have to offer unless you, you know... actually offer\u00a0it.\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s time to break the Ice before you freeze to death, buddy. \u00a0Is this all merely a fantasy for you?  A store window for you to gaze into, without ever going inside?\u00a0Requesting to see Secret Photos and clicking Favorites won\u2019t cut it\u2026 You\u2019ve got to get in the game. \u00a0\nFortune favors the bold.  So be bold.\u00a0Click here to reach out and touch someone.\nUntil next time, Cheers!\nHerb Rose\n-------\n      Don't want to receive amazing emails from us?\n      Manage your email settings here\n",

This year Republicans did well in a tough environment and increased their share in the Senate. And while we lost seats in the House, it should be noted that Democrats gained far fewer seats in the House this year compared to Republicans in recent history. Republicans gained 63 House seats in the 2010 midterms during President Obama\u2019s first term and 52 in the 1994 midterms during President Clinton\u2019s first term.\u201dRJC National Chairman Senator Norm Coleman said: \"President Trump and the Republican-led Congress accomplished so much in the last two years, including: recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the US embassy there, taking us out of the Iran deal and re-imposing strong sanctions, cutting back regulations and growing jobs in this country.\"Coleman continued: \"Now it is time for Republicans and Democrats to come together to continue to move our country forward and pursue thoughtful legislation to grow our economy, reform health care, secure our borders, and strengthen the US-Israel alliance.\"     Read more --\u00a0                  Innovative Technology Drove Record-Breaking Results for RJC PAC     Using innovative technology not deployed before by a Republican group, the RJC PAC this year raised nearly $750,000 for GOP candidates from Republican Jewish Coalition grassroots members. Here's how we did it:     The new platform, launched in July, allowed RJC small dollar members to donate to the RJC PAC and earmark contributions to specific candidates on the RJC PAC slate of 25 endorsees. The\u00a0result was record-breaking support from Republican Jewish Coalition grassroots members to the RJC PAC and the endorsed candidates.RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks said, \"We identified an area where the Left was doing a better job -- using the web to help groups on their side of the aisle bundle grassroots money directly to candidates -- giving Democrats an advantage. We had a new platform built on a custom web site that allowed our members to support the RJC PAC and our slate of endorsed candidates in a way that has never been done before on the Right and it really paid off.\"We dedicated 15 weeks to this project and the RJC PAC raised more than $385,000 for our slate of 25 endorsed candidates, Republicans who are pro-tax cuts, pro-defense, and pro-Israel. In addition, the RJC PAC brought in over $361,000, which supported Republicans in 61 races: 47 House races and 14 Senate races.\u00a0That\u2019s nearly $750,000 distributed directly to GOP candidates this cycle just via the RJC PAC. That does not include contributions to candidates made by RJC leaders at events sponsored by our Board Members. All told, we will have raised over $3 million for the 2018 midterm cycle to GOP candidates. This is our highest midterm election raise by far.\"We consider this technology the wave of the future for how groups on the Right can activate their members and effectively support great candidates in future elections. In fact, we have already started talking with other groups on the Right about how to make this technology work for them. We have a proven concept that other groups can invest in and expand upon.

Our efforts in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Dakota made a difference::     \"The Republican Jewish Coalition invested in independent expenditures in three important races -- Brian Fitzpatrick's House race against Democrat Scott Wallace in PA-1, Denver Riggleman's House race against Democrat Leslie Cockburn in VA-5, and Kevin Cramer's Senate race against Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota -- and Republicans won all three races.\u00a0\"Pennsylvania and Virginia were tough for Republican House candidates this year, but where we went in and educated voters about the Democrat candidate\u2019s record, voters responded.\u00a0\"Our ad in Pennsylvania concerned Scott Wallace\u2019s family foundation, which gave $300,000 in grants to organizations supporting Boycott/Divest/Sanction (BDS) against Israel under his leadership. It also noted Wallace\u2019s opposition to Pres. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the nuclear deal in Iran. In July, when the Cook Political Report changed the Fitzgerald-Wallace race rating from \u2018toss-up\u2019 to \u2018lean Republican',\u00a0they credited our ad campaign.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Our ad in Virginia highlighted liberal Democrat Leslie Cockburn\u2019s history of bashing Israel and dining with dictators and despots. Her book, Dangerous Liaison, is often cited by anti-Semitic hate groups to bolster their claim that Jews have too much control in our country. \u00a0 \"In North Dakota, we let voters know that Democrat Heidi Heitkamp had betrayed her constituents\u2019 values by supporting the Iran nuclear deal. Heitkamp was one of five Senate Democrats who supported the Iran deal and were in close races \u2013 four of them lost to their RJC-supported opponents. \u00a0     Read more and see the ads --\u00a0                  Sec. Pompeo and Sec. Mnuchin announce renewed US sanctions on Iran.     Trump Administration Places Toughest-Ever Sanctions on Iran     CNN reports:     The United States officially reimposed all penalties that had been lifted as part of the Iranian nuclear deal as the Trump administration added nearly 700 targets, including 50 Iranian financial institutions, to a sanctions list Monday.Trump administration officials said the reinstated sanctions marked an intensifying effort to strangle Iran's economy to pressure the regime to change its ways. Any company or country that does business with Tehran will feel the sting of US penalties, they said.\u00a0...In a sweeping list, the Treasury Department labeled an additional 700 entities, including individuals, banks, vessels, aircraft and Iran's energy sector as part of its decision to reapply harsh sanctions that kicked in early Monday morning. The reinstated sanctions follow the Trump administration's decision in May to pull out of the international nuclear deal...\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that eight countries would get waivers that would allow them to continue importing Iranian oil: China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.     Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin detailed the new sanctions in an op-ed this week.\u00a0One important element in the renewed US sanctions is that they have disconnected Iranian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the international network that allows financial institutions to securely conduct transactions around the globe.\u00a0This makes it extremely difficult for any companies to conduct business in Iran, but there is a humanitarian exemption. According to Bloomberg News,\u00a0some Iranian financial institutions that were not sanctioned could remain on SWIFT, but only to conduct transactions involving food and medicine.     The US sanctions also leave room for some countries to conduct limited oil trade with Iran. Eight countries have been granted waivers allowing them to import oil from Iran. This action keeps severe pressure on Iran while keeping oil prices from rising steeply in response to the sanctions. Analysts also speculate that granting waivers to countries such as Italy, Greece, and China - but not to the EU -\u00a0will put additional pressure on the EU, which has opposed the US reimposition of sanctions.               Correction:\u00a0The graphic in our last newsletter, listing the names of the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, was incorrect. The name of Irving Younger a\"h should have appeared there. We apologize for the error. May Mr. Younger's memory be a blessing.               \u2014 Short Takes \u2014               US oil production allows America to crack down on IranRJC Board of Directors member Fred Zeidman and Harold Hamm explain that increased US energy independence enhances our national security: \"America\u2019s status as a geopolitical powerhouse is enhanced as it grows into an energy exporter.\"\u00a0Israel thwarted 480 Palestinian terror attacks in past yearShin Bet director Nadav Argaman\u00a0also referred to 590 potential lone-wolf attacks that the Shin Bet had prevented, and the arrest of 219 Hamas cells in the West Bank.\u00a0Trump honors victims of communism\"Communism subordinates inherent human rights to the purported well-being of all, resulting in the extermination of religious freedom, private property, free speech, and, far too often, life,\" President Donald Trump said in a statement on the National Day for the Victims of Communism yesterday. November 7 marked 100 years since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.

You know how it feels on your birthday when you\u2019re just waking up, and it hits you that you\u2019re about to have a fu*king amazing day?

But it\u2019s not. My colleague Jeff Brown just recorded a mind-blowing video about it.\nI just watched it with my own eyes, and I STILL can't believe it.\nOne of the big reveals was how you could use a \"leak\" from Washington D.C. to become up to $150,000 richer as this situation evolves.\nIn fact, his research is so darned convincing. I'll be surprised if you don't.\nIn possibly the biggest tech breakthrough of his 25-year career...\nJeff reveals how to tap a hi-tech secret bigger than Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. COMBINED.\nAs he says at the 15:48 mark...\n\"Early pioneers in this arena have enjoyed rises of 8,900%... 17,000%... 62,000%...\"\nAnd he expects this one to be even BIGGER!\nAnd while he admits nothing in the market is guaranteed \u2013 the potential here is too great to ignore.\nI don't want to steal his thunder.\nGet the full story here.\nYours truly,\nWill Bonner\nPublisher, Bonner & Partners\nThis email is never sent unsolicited.

One of his most famous sayings is: \"Truth comes out in wine.\"\nDid he know about elderberry wine? Being a naturalist (and Roman), there's a good chance he did. After all, the health benefits of elderberry syrup for treating the symptoms of the flu have been anecdotally cited since before his time.\n\t\tSpecial: Thinning Hair? Pour This on Your Head and Watch What Happens\nBut it's only in the last 20 years that the medicinal properties of the elderberry have been scientifically documented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA small study published in 1998 showed that 93 percent of flu patients given elderberry syrup (Sambucol) were completely symptom-free within two days, while those taking a placebo recovered in about six days.\n           Another controlled study from 1999-2000 in Norway reported that flu patients taking three teaspoons of elderberry syrup four times a day saw their symptoms improve four days earlier than others who took a placebo.\n           And a randomized, double-blind trial in 2009 found that 48 hours after flu sufferers took elderberry extract, 28 percent of them were devoid of all flu symptoms and 60 percent showed some symptom relief. Not a single patient in the placebo control group showed any relief.\nElderberries are more bitter than blackberries or raspberries, which is why they're distilled into wines or baked in pies in combination with other berries.\nBut the concentrated syrup is what you want if you have flu symptoms. As the American Nutrition Association states, \"Elderberry extract seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza.\"\nSponsor \nPowerwash For Your Insides    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat if you could restore your gut health with one simple fix?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to one doctor in California there may be a way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, he believes it\u2019s so powerful that it could be like a \u201cpower wash\u201d for your insides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Gundry, who is a world-renowned heart surgeon, reveals the  root cause of weight gain, food cravings, and low energy in a short video he released to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.S.

One of his most famous sayings is: \"Truth comes out in wine.\"\nDid he know about elderberry wine? Being a naturalist (and Roman), there's a good chance he did. After all, the health benefits of elderberry syrup for treating the symptoms of the flu have been anecdotally cited since before his time.\n\t\tSpecial: Thinning Hair? Pour This on Your Head and Watch What Happens\nBut it's only in the last 20 years that the medicinal properties of the elderberry have been scientifically documented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA small study published in 1998 showed that 93 percent of flu patients given elderberry syrup (Sambucol) were completely symptom-free within two days, while those taking a placebo recovered in about six days.\n           Another controlled study from 1999-2000 in Norway reported that flu patients taking three teaspoons of elderberry syrup four times a day saw their symptoms improve four days earlier than others who took a placebo.\n           And a randomized, double-blind trial in 2009 found that 48 hours after flu sufferers took elderberry extract, 28 percent of them were devoid of all flu symptoms and 60 percent showed some symptom relief. Not a single patient in the placebo control group showed any relief.\nElderberries are more bitter than blackberries or raspberries, which is why they're distilled into wines or baked in pies in combination with other berries.\nBut the concentrated syrup is what you want if you have flu symptoms. As the American Nutrition Association states, \"Elderberry extract seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza.\"\nSponsor \nPowerwash For Your Insides    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat if you could restore your gut health with one simple fix?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAccording to one doctor in California there may be a way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, he believes it\u2019s so powerful that it could be like a \u201cpower wash\u201d for your insides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Gundry, who is a world-renowned heart surgeon, reveals the  root cause of weight gain, food cravings, and low energy in a short video he released to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.S.

Nothing...\nThat is, until Eric and I talked...\nIn our conversation, he realized he would be doing a disservice to the world by not sharing his message.\nSo we started working together.\nI remember at first, his idea was really broad (just like most people who reach out for support on getting clear on their TEDx idea)\u00a0\nWhen I heard his unique story, experience, expertise, and passion, I saw his talk and idea form so clearly...\nI shared it with him, we did a little back and forth, and then...boom!\nWe built his winning application...and within 3 weeks, Eric landed 2 TEDx talks!\u00a0\nFast forward\u00a0to today, and Eric's TEDx talk just went live (It's amazing, you can watch it here.)\nWe were on the phone together an hour ago, as I'm going to help Eric spread his talk to reach more people...\nAnd he said, \"Taylor, thanks for kicking my ass into gear. You helped me achieve a dream of mine.\"\nWow...That is why I do what I do.\nMy purpose now in life is to help other Thought Leaders amplify their positive messages.\nHelping world-changers like Eric achieve their dreams of speaking on the TEDx stage is a dream for me, too.\nI'm curious\u00a0, what is a dream you've had for years?\nHere's to making that dream a reality.\nBest,\nTaylor\nP.S.

This transit would bring in unexpected & dramatic changes in personal life as well as world events. This change comes in every 18 years and we would be revisiting the part of life as it was during 2000 to 2001. This was the period when Rahu & Ketu had last transited the signs Gemini & Sagittarius. During this period, many things happened that changed the world as we knew it & its effects remain till today. The most\nnotable event was the terror attack on the USA or 9/11 as we still remember so clearly. Also many other events such as the earthquake in India, Israel- Palestine conflict and Mad Cow disease yet again were the prominent events of this period.\nEach of these events had one thing in common. More than the event itself, the circumstances and situations as we had known, had changed for us during that period. It is the very nature of Rahu & Ketu that brings nearly 180 degree change. The very circumstances around us become different without any change in our own work, nature & abilities. This usually creates opportunities & changes we are not ready for & couldn\u2019t have planned for or insured in the normal circumstances. Like smoke screen, these changes would be coming out-of-the-blue & you might find yourself in new situations that you hadn\u2019t even imagined a few weeks back. Despite the new events which unfold, one certain thing is...Change!\nWe would prepare your Rahu - Ketu Transit  report covering various changes that this transit brings to your career & profession, love & married life, children & family & of course your financials and public position besides many other behavioral changes which you cannot anticipate but have to endure due to Rahu \u2013 Ketu transit. The report would cover the forecast, specific thoughts & ideas, suggestions, dates & periods of growth or caution & remedies for you. So that you are ready for the changes & opportunities that life throws at you. You can\nread more about it and then place your order.\nThis special http://indastro.com initiative is to help you with the changes till 2020 and grab the growth & gains coming your way without the warning.\nBlessings,\nPt.

My name is Steve Ramsey and I've been teaching people woodworking on YouTube for the last decade.It all started with a chess board I made back in\n2008. I thought it would be fun to document the process and post it on YouTube. Since then I\u2019ve helped millions of people build their first woodworking projects. I believe that anyone can make unique, practical pieces out of wood. And I want to show you how! If you haven\u2019t already, sign up for my newsletter and over the next couple of days, I will show you that you don\u2019t need a lot of money, a huge workshop, tons of tools or years of experience to build some impressive looking projects. Plus then you\u2019ll receive my regular updates about new woodworking project videos, free plans, and upcoming woodworking courses.To get started, here\u2019s my curated list of most affordable woodworking tools: Curated Tool ListThis is the exact list of tools I use in my online course The Weekend Woodworker to build some very impressive looking projects (that are simple to build). You\u2019ll find out more about that if you sign up for my newsletter. If you clicked no before, you can just head back here to join the woodworking fun :)Best,\u2013 Steve\nFor Mere Mortals, 448 Ignacio Blvd. #237, Novato, CA 94949, United States\nUpdate Preferences |\u00a0Unsubscribe\n",
