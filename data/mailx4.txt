The brightest days are ahead of you and I hope you have yourself a wonderful day!\n Cheers,\nKyle\nCo-founder of Wealthy Affiliate\nWealthyAffiliate.com\nHosting\nWebsites\nSupport\nTraining\nDomains\n\u00a9 2018 WealthyAffiliate.com\nManage your email preferences\n",

The most common roofing material in the United States is asphalt shingles. In the past, 3-tab shingles were used; nowadays, \"architectural\" or \"dimensional\" shingles are becoming very popular.\nDepending on the region, other commonly applied roofing materials installed by roofers include concrete tiles, clay tiles, natural or synthetic slate, single-ply (primarily EPDM rubber, PVC, or TPO), rubber shingles (made from recycled tires), glass, metal panels or shingles, wood shakes or shingles, liquid-applied, hot asphalt/rubber, foam, thatch, and solar tiles. \"Living roof\" systems, or rooftop landscapes, have become increasingly common in recent years in both residential and commercial applications.\nIn the United States, regulation of the roofing trade is left up to individual states. Some states leave roofing regulation up to county-level and municipal-level jurisdictions. In California, for example, the California Contractors State License Board licenses and monitors roofing contractors. Unlicensed contracting of projects worth over a set threshold may result in stiff fines or even time in prison. In Oklahoma roofers are required to meet insurance and roofing license guidelines. Roofers are also required to show their license number on their marketing material.\nThe United Kingdom has no legislation in place that requires a roofer to have a license to trade, although some do belong to recognized trade organizations\n",

The stem is often spiny. The flowers are white to purple in color, with a five-lobed corolla and yellow stamens. Some common cultivars have fruit that is egg-shaped, glossy, and purple with white flesh and a spongy, \"meaty\" texture. Some other cultivars are white and longer in shape. The cut surface of the flesh rapidly turns brown when the fruit is cut open (oxidation). Eggplant grows 40 to 150 cm (1.3 to 4.9 ft) tall, with large, coarsely lobed leaves that are 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) broad. Semiwd types can grow much larger, to 225 cm (7.38 ft), with large leaves over 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (5.9 in) broad. On wd plants, the fruit is less than 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter; in cultivated forms: 30 cm (12 in) or more in length are possible for long, narrow types or the large fat purple ones common to the West. Botanically classified as a berry, the fruit contains numerous small, soft, edible seeds that taste bitter because they contain or are covered in nicotinoid alkaloids, like the related tobacco. History Long purple eggplants The plant species is believed to have originated in India, where it continues to grow wd. It has been cultivated in southern and eastern Asia since prehistory. The first known written record of the plant is found in Qimin Yaoshu, an ancient Chinese agricultural treatise completed in 544. The numerous Arabic and North African names for it, along with the lack of the ancient Greek and Roman names, indicate it was introduced throughout the Mediterranean area by the Arabs in the early Middle Ages. A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Arabic Spain described how to grow aubergines. Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish. The aubergine is unrecorded in England until the 16th century. An English botany book in 1597 stated: \n",

Or is it just a waste of time?\nThe answer to both questions can be yes. It's critical to plan for success. More importantly, there are steps to follow to make it happen.\nMost businesses don't do any strategic planning. And, of the ones who do, most treat it as nothing more than an academic exercise. This is unfortunate. With some effort and a willingness to make hard decisions, it's possible to create more than just strategy.\nIt's possible to realize bottom-line results from a well-developed strategic plan that is then put into action and followed through.\nRead the Full Article\nGet SmartDraw for the Lowest Price\nBuy Today\nYou control the e-mail you get from SmartDraw Software: UnlistSmartDraw Software, LLC | 9909 Mira Mesa Blvd. | San Diego, CA 92131 | USA\u00a91994-2018 SmartDraw, LLC\n",

At Noble Gold, we think it is grave.\nWe've been warning that this was going to happen and that Americans must diversify and protect themselves with gold and precious metals.

            "msg_body": "The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long, pinnate, with (3\u2013) 5\u20139 (\u201313) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from South east Asia) are evergreen or nearly so. The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa sericea, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes. Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine\u2014especially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi. Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals. Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous produc ers in the UK. The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5\u2013160 \"seeds\" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds. \n",

            "msg_body": "On the run? TO OPEN OUR GRATITUDE SALE FOR NOVEMBER: I am offering my highest education on gluten, autoimmunity, food sensitivity and toxins to the public. Yes, my Certified Gluten Practitioner information is open to the public (without certification) for only $497.\nDear James kahn,\nI have seen thousands of parents struggle with the health of their children, presenting with conditions and symptoms, losing thousands of dollars AND TIME, only to discover that food sensitivities were at the root of the problem. It\u2019s time to change this. \nIt\u2019s time to put the highest EDUCATION in your hands. As a tweak to something Bob Seger once said \u201cWish I didn\u2019t know now, what I didn\u2019t know then.\u201d \nThat an unrecognized, high-homocysteine level took my dad\u2019s life.\nOr that an untreated leaky gut allowing LPS to get into the bloodstream for years, eventually causing sepsis and taking my mom\u2019s life. \nOr how, exactly, does wheat sensitivity fuel cardiovascular disease? Or cancer? \nHOW can you impact the trajectory of inflammation and over 100 autoimmune disease?\nAnd how does gluten SNEAK into a diet and make children (and adults) sick on every level. \nUnfortunately, with the toxicity in our world today, we all have to learn the basics of this reality to protect ourselves, our children and our future generations. \nI have been thinking a lot about legacy and the world my grandchildren will inherit. \nThe information in my Certified Gluten Practitioner Program is so full of startling data - and it began what has become a revolution in HUMAN-driven health, where, at our best, education is the new pharma.\nI want my community to have this information. So I am doing something unprecedented in the world of professional courses.  \nI am opening the vault of information, that is usually reserved to health practitioners, to the world at large for less than 25% of what the course costs the professionals. \nClick here to get this before it closes - * I am offering this to you for 2 days ONLY for $497.  THERE ARE a few caveats: This is a limited offer and ends in 2 days. (Sorry, NO extensions.)\nMOST IMPORTANT: This is not for professional accreditation - it\u2019s the education, without the exam and certification. You will not have access to any of the bonus materials that our professional CGPs get on an ongoing basis. And you will not be included in our CGP map on theDr.com or in our private group. BUT it is the right information to change your life and the lives of those you love.\nThis Course took years to develop. Once you own this, it is yours for a year, to help you change your life AND those you love. \nThis course will open your eyes to the foundation of what I call the Trilogy. The trilogy consists of the following:\n* Your Genetics / Epigenetics. This is the \u2018deck of cards\u2019 that you were born with. You can't change your genes, but you can HIGHLY impact if certain genes are expressed or not (meaning turned on or off). \n* Environmental Triggers. What are your environmental and autoimmune triggers? Is it gluten, mercury, toxins? Learn what you must know to live better.\n* Intestinal Permeability. Do you have Leaky Gut? What is Leaky Gut? What's the gut-brain connection? Can leaky gut affect ANY part of your body? How can you stop its progression? \nI\u2019ve combined the best of both worlds for you\u2026videos from my CGP practitioner-level training program PLUS the most important tools and handouts designed for normal, day-to-day human beings. THIS is how you \u2018up your education\u2019 and improve your well-being!  \nAnd look, you might still want a CERTIFIED Gluten Practitioner to help you employ what you learn. I will send you the map for these rare and powerful helpmates. But knowing this research and having these tools changes the game.\nBy implementing small, but critical steps (base hits) you will be empowered (and inspired) to create greater health and vitality! After all, it\u2019s base hits that win the ball game!\nI hope you will use this incredible high-level training to improve your health and the lives of those you love.\nSincerely,Dr. Tom O\u2019Bryan\nPS: Almost a thousand professionals, from ALL around the world, have done this course. It\u2019s time for everyone to get this content. Click here to watch a brief video message about the program.\nThis special offer is for anyone wanting a more comprehensive understanding of autoimmunity, gluten and its related disorders.\u200b\u200b \nLearn how celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity symptoms outside of the GI tract, such as depression, brain fog, anxiety, fatigue, muscle pain, neuralgia, and more. \nNeed more information - click above to watch a powerful video. \nPPS: The offering is NOT my certification program. You will NOT be tested or certified to become a Certified Gluten Practitioner through this program. It is solely intended to be educational. If you are interested in becoming CERTIFIED, please click here for that program or contact our CGP Program Coordinator at CGPInfo@TheDr.com. \n\u201cCourse rating: 5 stars! Course feedback: Learning about the tremendous impact of gluten and its relation to so many chronic diseases was mind blowing. Great information that I look forward to using with clients in my health coaching business!!!\u201d ~ Deborah C.\nCick here to update your preferences.\nTheDr.com 31120 Kingswood Blvd Ste 112 Novi, Michigan 48377-1624 United States (877) 458-8361\n",

Indeed, scientists have hypothesized that sugar addiction is just as real as drug or alcohol addiction. However, experiments on humans and animals have so far come up empty handed.\nHaving said that, some people find it harder than others to resists sweets. If you are one of them, here are some ideas and suggestions\nRead more\nNo, Saturated Fat isn't Healthy for You!\nSaturated fat has made a comeback of sorts in the last 5 years, after decades of being vilified by the nutrition community. Unfortunately, this revival is based on a wrong interpretation of scientific studies. We've written about this matter extensively, for example here.\nIn a nutshell: Replacing foods high in saturated fats with foods that contain unsaturated fats reduces the risk of heart disease. However, replacing foods high in saturated fats with foods that contain refined carbs doesn't change the risk much.\nHere's what you need to know:\nRead more\nDon't let the upcoming holiday season be an excuse to stop eating healthy!\nUpgrade to Fooducate PRO and customize the app to match your diet:\nlow-carb\nketo\npaleo\nvegan\norganic\nnon-GMO\nDiabetes and prediabetes\nKindney disease (stages 1 to 5)\nIBS and low FODMAP diet\nPCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome\nand more...\nWith Fooducate PRO you can track your macros and individual nutrients to maximize your health.\ncarbs\nprotein\nfats\nsodium\niron\nand more...\n(Tap on the link from a mobile device)\nGo PRO\nAre You Eating Enough Fish?\nOctober was National Seafood Month, another made up marketing holiday set up to support America's fishing industry. That said, fish and seafood are healthy, lean sources of protein and other nutrients (omega-3 and vitamin D for example). The USDA recommends two servings of fish and seafood a week, but less than 10 percent of the population abides.\nPart of the reason is that it's a bit more challenging to prepare fish compared to a piece of chicken, beef, or pork. When dealing with a whole fish, there is the issue of the bones, the skin, the head. That's why most Americans prefer filets of larger fish such as salmon or tuna. There is also the fishy smell that some people find repugnant, especially for food that has been prepared in advance and then reheated.\nThere are solutions to all these issues of course. Here are some ideas for you.\nRead more\nPumpkin Babies\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall and pumpkin season is in full swing.

            "msg_body": "HELPFUL TOOLS, TIPS AND ADVICE\nHow to be creative with the basics\nAccording to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to be creative, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask, \u00e2\u0080\u0098why do we have to do it that way, why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we do it another way,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 then humanity doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist\".\u00a0Being creative can be the winning difference for your team and make match days just that bit more special.\u00a0Here are four ways to be creative with basic soccer skills that can give your team a winning edge:\u00a0One of the best ways to get the ball into the penalty area in different ways is to give your players freedom on the wings. Crossing is one of the harder skills that wingers need and it helps them to catch out defenders on the counterattack without stopping or slowing the attack down. Try Crossing to help you coach it.\u00a0Practising individual techniques at free kicks is something players can do on their own during a break in training or when they are in their back yard at home. When he was at Manchester United David Beckham would spend a lot of time practising his free-kicks from just outside the box. Lots of goals come from free-kicks but accuracy is more important than power in youth soccer because the goalkeeper will struggle to get anything in the corners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Free kick practice is a great way to do this.\u00a0Winning the ball when defending a corner is not only important defensively, it can also spark your team into a fast counter attacking move that catches opponents still upfield. To achieve this, your team must organise and capitalise on clever positioning of players. Try Corner rebels to get your players winning the ball and counter attacking against their opponents.\u00a0You need a good small sided game to let your players loose and show you their creativity \u00e2\u0080\u0093 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about mistakes just let them play. Creative in the box is a fast game that relies on individual skill and teamwork to create shooting opportunities. The coaching points rely on the skills of players to be creative around the opposition goal, mirroring the role of skilful midfielders like Manchester City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s David Silva, who can conjure up chances at will.\nHead coach and editor,Soccer Coach Weekly\nCrossing\nCrossing is one of the harder skills that wingers need and it helps them to catch out defenders on the counterattack without stopping or slowing the attack down...MORE\nFree kick practice\nDavid Beckham used to improve his free-kicks at Manchester United by firing the ball through a car tyre hanging from a goal.

            "msg_body": "Goedemiddag Kelly,\nZoals elke donderdagmiddag hebben we de twaalf allerbeste stukken uit de tijdschriften van deze week weer op een rijtje gezet. Als extraatje, boven op je dagelijkse selectie. Veel leesplezier! \ud83d\udc47\nEen mooi gesprek met Jan Mulder over zijn roman, Groningen, matchfixing en de dood: \u2018Ik ben bereid half als robot voort te leven\u2019\nEen uitspraak die Mulder treffend omschrijft, volgt op de vraag welke eigenschappen bij zowel het voetballen als schrijven van pas komen: \u2018Ik heb altijd van de esthetiek van het voetbal gehouden. Ik had gevoel voor het drama van het spel.\u2019 \u20ac0.85\nDe mislukte hack van Russische spionnen in Den Haag werd wereldnieuws. Wat kwamen ze doen? Hoe liepen ze in de val? Een reconstructie\nDe vier Russen begonnen hun missie in het zuidwesten van Moskou, maar strandden in een lift van het Marriott Hotel in Den Haag. \u20ac0.49\nEen beer, een dolfijn of toch een wolf? Als je weet welk slaaptype je bent, word je leven een stuk makkelijker\nWant die oude tweedeling tussen ochtendmens en avondmens is eigenlijk veel te beperkt. \u20ac0.79\nDit is niet de eerste aanklacht tegen de narcistische selfiecultuur, maar wel een die erg goed geschreven is: \u2018Ik selfie, dus ik besta\u2019\nMyrthe Hilkens fileert \u2018mediapersoonlijkheden\u2019 als Kim Kardashian met priemende zinnen als: \u2018We hyperventileren ons door de dag, maar dankzij filters toveren we alle tekenen van verval als bij toverslag van onze gezichten.\u2019 \u20ac0.69\nHier het verhaal van een techjournalist die probeert anoniem online te gaan (en daar niet in slaagt)\nWant dat het niet lukt om al je sporen voor Google en Facebook uit te wissen vermoedden we al. Maar de trucs die deze journalist uit de kast haalt zijn het lezen zeker waard. \u20ac0.49\nOnno van de Stolpe (nummer 489 in de Quote 500) over zijn miljardenbedrijf en levenswerk: het biotechbedrijf Galapagos\nDat Van de Stolpe vertrouwen heeft in zijn bedrijf kun je wel zeggen. \u2018Ik zie geen reden waarom wij over een paar jaar niet meer waard zouden zijn dan Philips.\u2019 \u20ac0.99\nHoe de Nederlandse Napolitaan Mino Raiola uitgroeide tot een van de meest gevreesde en succesvolle spelersmakelaars\nBij de wereld van voetbaltransfers denken we al snel aan louche en schimmige praktijken. Raiola ziet dat anders: hij zou mensen gaan helpen. \u2018Mijn ouders hoopten op een beroep als dokter, maar dit komt aardig in de buurt.\u2019 \u20ac0.49\nAls eerste van de \u2018Grote Vier van Oranje\u2019 stopt Rafael van der Vaart met voetballen. Een terugblik op zijn fraaie carri\u00e8re\nVI kijkt daarnaast ook alvast vooruit. \u2018Ik denk dat ik ook als trainer genoeg te bieden heb.\u2019 \u20ac0.49\nEen chaotisch gesprek in een rommelig huis, een betere metafoor is er niet voor het leven van actrice Loes Luca\nEr liggen overal lijstjes met taakjes. De belangrijkste: haar demente moeder verzorgen. Dan maar wat minder acteren. \u2018Nee, op het podium neervallen, is niets voor mij. Geeft zo\u2019n rommel.\u2019 \u20ac0.89\nTwintig jaar geleden maakte de wereld kennis met auto-tune. Een verhaal over het geluid dat voor de klank van de 21ste eeuw zorgde\nHet was Cher die er met haar nummer Believe mee begon. Later zouden er tientallen artiesten volgen, van Daft Punk tot Katy Perry en van Radiohead tot Kanye West. \u20ac0.59\nDeze gevangenen denken na over hoe ze hun angst kunnen \u2018kapotdenken\u2019\nDeel 3 van de filosofiecursus in de bajes. Dit keer komt Bertrand Russel aan bod, die vindt dat je je angst onder ogen moet zien. En dat zorgt voor onrust in de groep. \u20ac0.95\nEen fijne avond.\nSjors, Bram, Kim, Cas, Anna, Tjeerd, Laurens, Thijs & Roland\nPSSST! Jack is nog altijd verliefd op zijn eerste liefde, die net als hij getrouwd is met een ander. \u2018Tijdens mijn openingsdans dacht ik aan haar.\u2019\n Elke dag onbeperkt toegang tot alle artikelen in deze nieuwsbrief?\n Dat kan met Blendle Premium.\n Is deze nieuwsbrief naar je doorgestuurd?\n Da's aardig!

The stem is often spiny. The flowers are white to purple in color, with a five-lobed corolla and yellow stamens. Some common cultivars have fruit that is egg-shaped, glossy, and purple with white flesh and a spongy, \"meaty\" texture. Some other cultivars are white and longer in shape. The cut surface of the flesh rapidly turns brown when the fruit is cut open (oxidation). Eggplant grows 40 to 150 cm (1.3 to 4.9 ft) tall, with large, coarsely lobed leaves that are 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) long and 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) broad. Semiwd types can grow much larger, to 225 cm (7.38 ft), with large leaves over 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (5.9 in) broad. On wd plants, the fruit is less than 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter; in cultivated forms: 30 cm (12 in) or more in length are possible for long, narrow types or the large fat purple ones common to the West. Botanically classified as a berry, the fruit contains numerous small, soft, edible seeds that taste bitter because they contain or are covered in nicotinoid alkaloids, like the related tobacco. History Long purple eggplants The plant species is believed to have originated in India, where it continues to grow wd. It has been cultivated in southern and eastern Asia since prehistory. The first known written record of the plant is found in Qimin Yaoshu, an ancient Chinese agricultural treatise completed in 544. The numerous Arabic and North African names for it, along with the lack of the ancient Greek and Roman names, indicate it was introduced throughout the Mediterranean area by the Arabs in the early Middle Ages. A book on agriculture by Ibn Al-Awwam in 12th-century Arabic Spain described how to grow aubergines. Records exist from later medieval Catalan and Spanish. The aubergine is unrecorded in England until the 16th century. An English botany book in 1597 stated: \n",

I am Mr. Louis Lloyds, a principal partner with LL & Hans Associates, based in London, I was searching for a similar name on your country\u2019s Government Data Base, via the internet, when i came across yours which prompted me to contact you, I believe you will read this carefully and understand with me, As this will be of a benefit to both of us. I am the private Lawyer to a deceased client who share similar last name with you.My late client who share similar last name with you had a wife named Rosa and two children, daughter named Amanda 10 years and son named Randall 16 years. My late client was trapped dead alongside his wife and daughter on a collapsed building June 7, 2013 built by one of the construction company here in London not long ago, the son who only survived then in the family had gone to school on that day.After the tragedy the construction company pleaded guilty of breaching the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2010 and Randal the only survived member of the family then was compensated with \u04087.5M GBP (Seven million, five hundred thousand Great Britain Pounds), And was deposited in a bank here in London under my guardian. Unfortunately on the 4th of January 2014 Randall the only son died in the hospital after suffering from Cancer of the blood. Since the death of Randall there is no one to inherit the money, due to the fact that every member of the family all dead, the late father and late mother were orphans and had no relative here in London.I have reason very professional and I can use a legal means to present a next of kin of my deceased client. This is legally possible and would be done in accordance with the laws. On this note I decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear a similar name, I was urged to contact you, that I may, with your consent, present you to the \u201cTrustee\u201d as my late client\u2019s family members to enable you put up a claim to the bank in that capacity as a next of kin of my late client.I have all vital documents that would confer you the legal right to make this claim and would make them available to you so that the proceeds of this bank account valued at \u04087.5M GBP can be paid to you before it gets confiscated or declared unserviceable to the bank where this huge amount is lodged.For this I seek your consent and assistance to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since I have been unable to locate the relatives for the past four years now, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you and then both of us can share the money, 50% to me and 50% to you. I know there might be other persons out there with the same similar name as my late client but after a little check my instinct tells me to contact you. Can I trust you on this? I shall assemble all the necessary documents that will be used to back up this claim.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have been made for the completion of this transfer.If this offer is acceptable by you, please reply direct to my email (dmk120dmk@yahoo.co.jp) and Note this proposal is confidential.Regards,Mr. Louis Lloyds(principal partner)\n",

Will it hit the lows of earlier in the year - then bounce back? Or will it keep going? And it\u2019s not just the S&P, Nasdaq is down 4.4% - the Dow Jones fell 2.4% in just one day this week - and stocks in Hong Kong, China and Japan are now consistently falling too!\nSo, is it a blip? Or is it way more serious? At Noble Gold, we think it is grave.\nWe've been warning that this was going to happen and that Americans must diversify and protect themselves with gold and precious metals. Here's a fact, while the market has dropped, gold has risen 16% since 2016.\nGold will hold its value and keep your investment safe through any coming financial storm. The latest chance to do this has almost gone - what do you think will happen to the gold price if the market really tanks?\nDownload our Free Gold and Silver Guide and learn how you can:\nProtect you and your family's wealth\nThrive in an unstable economic environment\nDiversify your portfolio with Gold and precious metals\nHow to\u00a0protect\u00a0and\u00a0grow\u00a0your 401(k), IRA, or retirement account!\nYou have been worrying about the national debt for years, and the time to act is here.

Across Europe and many other parts of the world, people will fall silent on Sunday to mark 100 years since the end of the First World War and world leaders of every stature will gather in France to pay their respects. In anticipation, The Telegraph has put together a series of articles debating Britain\u2019s place in European security then, now and in the future. The final part, looking at the role of national service in Britain, will be published tomorrow.Across the Atlantic, we have witnessed another instalment in the great drama of American democracy, with citizens of the United States voting for their representatives in Congress in the midterm elections. The results have been much less decisive than many had predicted, and the US appears just as divided as it was in 2016. The question that I imagine is on lots of your minds is: What does this mean for 2020? Well, our data team have taken a look at the stats and found that the Democrats shouldn\u2019t be too confident of making Donald Trump the first one-term president since George Bush Sr.With autumn having well and truly arrived, many of you will be faced with the difficulties of managing housebound children and their ever-growing piles of homework. You are not alone. In a refreshing interview, Charlize Theron opens up to Kate Bussmann about the difficulties of being a parent, not being afraid to ask for help and what choosing adoption meant for her.Now yoga is a marvellous thing, but the idea of five hours a day for a week is enough to make my muscles cringe. That prospect hasn\u2019t deterred Charlotte Cox, who spent seven days in the Tuscan hills on a yoga retreat and cut out all toxins while she was at it. Is Charlotte fully recharged and more flexible than ever, or still crumpled in a heap and aching all over? You\u2019ll have to read this to find out.Finally, I\u2019m sure many of you will have sat through the agonising tension of last Saturday\u2019s 12-11 victory for England over South Africa, and there\u2019s another big weekend of rugby to come. No doubt you\u2019ll be wondering how England will cope when they face the intimidating might of the All Blacks and what hope there is of repeating that famous 2014 victory. Charlie Morgan has taken a look at the mistakes England need to cut out and the good habits they can build on.I hope you are enjoying this newsletter, but do please continue to send me your thoughts.

None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5 to 6 cm (2 to 2.3 in) wide and 14 to 16 cm (5 to 6 in) long when intact. The specimen was found in a stratigraphic area that indicates Nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. Nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by skin beetles. The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous. Nemegtomaia is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in the same area. Nemegtomaia is estimated to have been around 2 m (7 ft) in length, and to have weighed 40 kg (85 lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, it would have been feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185 mm (7 in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152 mm (6 in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144 mm (5 in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) is estimated to have been 286 mm (11 in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317 mm long (12 in). Restoration of a nesting individual The skull of Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared to the rest of the body), and reached 179 mm (7 in) in length. It had a well-developed crest, formed by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the holotype's crest formed an almost 90 degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, the nasal processes (projections) of the premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52 mm (2 in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull. Preserved parts and reconstruction of specimen MPC-D 107/15's skull The jaws of Nemegtomaia were toothless, and like other oviraptorid dinosaurs, it had a short snout with a deep, robust, and somewhat parrot-like beak. It had a hard palate formed by the premaxillae, vomers, and maxillae, like other oviraptorids. The palate was strongly concave (downwards-projecting), and had a cleft on the central part. As in other oviraptorids, it had a pair of tooth-like projections on the palate that were directed downwards (a feature that has been called \"pseudo-teeth\"). Nemegtomaia had small foramina (openings) on the sides of the suture (joint) between the premaxillae at the front of the snout, which may have been nutrient openings (and which indicate the presence of a keratinous bill). The lower jaw was short and deep, with a convex lower surface, and reached 153 mm (6 in) in length. The dentary bone of the lower jaw reached 50 mm (2 in) at its highest point. The mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was short, deep, and very pneumatised (with air-spaces). The mandibular fenestra was large and was located at the front part of the lower jaw. As in most other oviraptorids, the front of the lower jaw was down-turned. Though Nemegtomaia does not possess any single features that distinguish it from other oviraptorids (autapomorphies), the combination of a crest, an enlarged first finger, and a high number of sacral vertebrae (eight), is unique to this taxon. History of discovery Maps showing the Nemegt locality (a, b) and where Nemegtomaia specimens have been found (c) In 1996 the Japanese palaeontologist Yoshitsugu Kobayashi (as part of the \"Mongolian Highland International Dinosaur Project\" team) found an incomplete skeleton of an oviraptorid dinosaur in the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert in southwestern Mongolia. The specimen (MPC-D 100/2112 at the Mongolian Palaeontological Center, formerly PC and GIN 100/2112), consists of a nearly complete skull and a partial skeleton, including cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, a left scapula, the lower ends of both humeri, the right radius, both ilia, the upper ends of both pubes, both ischia, and the upper end of a femur. The specimen was described as a new specimen of the genus Ingenia (referred to as Ingenia sp.; of uncertain species) by the Chinese palaeontologist L\u00fc Junchang and colleagues in 2002, and used to highlight the similarities between oviraptorosaurs and birds. Skeletal diagrams showing the preserved elements of the three known specimens in grey, composite on right In 2004 L\u00fc and colleagues determined that the skeleton belonged to a new, distinct taxon, and made it the holotype specimen of Nemegtia barsboldi. The genus name refers to the Nemegt Basin, and the specific name honours the Mongolian palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold, the leader of the team that found the specimen. In 2005 the describers discovered (after being notified by a biologist) that the name Nemegtia had already been used for a genus of freshwater seed shrimp (Ostracoda) from the same formation in 1978, and was therefore preoccupied. They proposed instead the new genus name Nemegtomaia (\"maia\" means \"good mother\" in Greek, and the full name means \"good mother of the Nemegt\"), making reference to the then-recent discovery that oviraptorids brooded eggs rather than stealing them, though no trace of a nest or eggs had yet been found associated with Nemegtomaia itself. The first known member of the oviraptorid family was found with a nest of eggs originally thought to have belonged to the ceratopsian genus Protoceratops, and was therefore named Oviraptor in 1924; this name means \"egg-seizer\". In the 1990s more oviraptorid specimens were discovered associated with nests and eggs, wherein oviraptorid embryos were found, thereby proving that the eggs belonged to the oviraptorids themselves. Ingenia was similarly renamed as Ajancingenia in 2013, since the former genus name was preoccupied by a roundworm (Nematoda).

The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it may be related to the presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping. The brooding behaviour of oviraptorids is thought to have been similar to that of palaeognath birds; here, a male Somali ostrich\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVarious studies have suggested that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 the American palaeontologist David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals. Diet and feeding Lower jaw of the holotype specimen, with beak on the right\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diet of oviraptorids has been interpreted in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly thought to have been a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and the wear facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the\n",

Barely able to budge.\nThen, just to be able to walk upright, I'd have to go through nearly 30 minutes of painful and tedious stretches.\nIt was like I had to talk my body into just doing basic movements.\nI would see those drawings of neanderthals from thousands of years ago hunched over and think: \"Yep that's me!\"\nAnd throughout the day I'd have to come back to that routine just so I could move around without holding onto walls and railings.\nBut all that changed when I found this.\nNow? Now I sleep like a rock.\nNow I wake completely rested and refreshed.\nI spring out of bed like I'm 8 years old and it's a snow day.\nI move without pain throughout the day.\nIt's like someone took a giant oil can and lubricated my entire body and it's back to the smooth running machine I had in my youth.\nNow I exercise more, I walk and hike more, I even work on the house more because bending over doesn't cause excruciating pain like it used to.\nAnd it's all thanks to this.\nThis tree was originally the type species of the genus Acacia, which derives its name from \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u00ce\u00af\u03b1 (akakia), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40\u201390) to this tree as a medicinal, in his book Materia Medica. The renaming of the genus to Vachellia remains controversial. The genus name Acacia derives from the Greek word for its characteristic thorns, \u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2 (akis, thorn). The species name nilotica was given by Linnaeus from this tree's best-known range along the Nile river. The plant V. nilotica then, in turn, became the type species for the Linnaean genus Acacia (not all of which have thorns, even though they are named for them). For the ongoing reclassification of this and other species historically classified under genus Acacia, see the Acacia. Description Spring blossoms at Hodal in Faridabad District of Haryana, India Vachellia nilotica is a tree 5\u201320 m high with a dense spheric crown, stems and branches usually dark to black coloured, fissured bark, grey-pinkish slash, exuding a reddish low quality gum. The tree has thin, straight, light, grey spines in axillary pairs, usually in 3 to 12 pairs, 5 to 7.5 cm (3 in) long in young trees, mature trees commonly without thorns. The leaves are bipinnate, with 3\u20136 pairs of pinnulae and 10\u201330 pairs of leaflets each, tomentose, rachis with a gland at the bottom of the last pair of pinnulae. Flowers in globulous heads 1.2\u20131.5 cm in diameter of a bright golden-yellow color, set up either axillary or whorly on peduncles 2\u20133 cm long located at the end of the branches. Pods are strongly constricted, hairy, white-grey, thick and softly tomentose. Its seeds number approximately 8000/kg. \n",
