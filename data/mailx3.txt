We need to make sure her team has the resources and grassroots support they need to fight back and win this thing, which is why I\u2019m asking you to step up today:\nWill you send an emergency contribution of $10 or more to Stacey Abrams' campaign to ensure every vote in Georgia is counted?\nIf you\u2019ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation to Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris will go through immediately:\nexpress donate: $10\nexpress donate: $25\nexpress donate: $50\nexpress donate: $100\nexpress donate: $250\nor, donate another amount\nWhen a candidate for governor \u2014 who also happens to be responsible for overseeing Georgia\u2019s elections \u2014 is purging voters and creating real confusion at the polls, we have to call it what it is: voter suppression.\nAnd we have to fight it. As Stacey said last night, no one should ever be unseen, unheard, or uninspired \u2014 and every single vote should be counted in this race.\nThanks for stepping up again to make history in Georgia.\n\u2014Kamala\n\u201cEvery moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.\u201d\n\u2013 Dolores Huerta\nPAID FOR BY KAMALA HARRIS FOR SENATE\nThis email was sent to Hall@mailinator.com.

There are more races still to be called, but so far, 21 of the 23 seats Democrats needed to flip to win the majority were won by our women. That will be huge in holding the Trump administration accountable.\n\tWe also TRIPLED the number of pro-choice Democratic women governors in the country, creating a strong defense against the dangerous anti-choice Republican agenda at the state level.\n\tAnd down the ballot, hundreds of our state and local women won \u2014 Democrats flipped six state legislative chambers, broke up Republican supermajorities in four, and gained Democratic supermajorities in two.In short: EMILY's List women changed the face of government last night.\n\tHere's a closer look at our historic wins:\nSENATE:\n\tSo far, 10 of our candidates won, including Jacky Rosen (NV), who flipped a seat from red to blue. She joins nine of our women who were up for re-election and won.HOUSE:\n\tThirty-eight of our women have won so far, including 21 of our candidates who were running to flip seats and who helped turn the House blue! Among those wins are so many historic firsts, like the first Native American and Muslim women elected to Congress.GOVERNORS:\n\tSix of our candidates have won so far, including four women who flipped seats. Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM) was one of those flips, and she will be the first Democratic Hispanic woman governor in the country.STATE & LOCAL:\n\tAnd more than 250 of our state and local women won their elections, creating an incredible pipeline of strong candidates who have bright careers ahead of them and who will continue to change the face of power for years to come.\n\tWe'll keep you posted as more races are called, but after last night, one thing is already clear: A historic number of women who will defend our rights will be sworn in in January.That is the power of this community.\n\tAnd I couldn't be more proud.\n\tThank you for joining the fight,\n\tStephanie Schriock\n\tPresident, EMILY's List\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOur work doesn\u2019t stop just because Election Day is over. Some of our races are still too close to call or heading into runoffs, and we\u2019re going to keep working to elect women next year and for years to come.Can you donate $3 to help elect even more pro-choice Democratic women?\nEMILY's List is a community of over five million members that helps elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.\n                                            Paid for by EMILY's List \n                                            www.emilyslist.org and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n1800 M Street NW, Suite 375N, Washington, DC 20036\nThank you for being a supporter of EMILY's List.

How sure are you that the people you have been dealing with on this matter for years are truly who they claim they are?\nWhy not come straight with me, maybe we could work closely to resolving this prolonged dilemma. Sometimes, the best way of achieving set goals is to confront situations by yourself. In the case of your suspended fund transfer, I do not see any contending factor that cannot be resolved with my full support.

It includes: \nThe 13 best (and most  profitable) ways to earn your keep (and then some) overseas and how to get started...\nChoosing a base for your brick-and-mortar business...  \nNo-work  opportunities that will  bring in a reliable monthly paycheck...\nTales from current expats who are already out there,  living on their own terms... \nFull  details are here.\n           ----------------------------- \n\"This is so much more than I expected...\n\"I mean... I don't know what I expected! But I'm so glad  I came.\n\"What I've learned is that there are many ways to make  money overseas. I was thinking I needed to choose one strategy and then focus  on it alone. But now I see that I could pursue a number of different strategies  for generating multiple streams of income at the same time...\"\n--Attendee at last week's Make Money Overseas Event\nDear Overseas Opportunity Letter Reader,\n  Until recently,  if you wanted to teach English overseas\u2014one of the most accessible gigs for  job-seeking expats\u2014you needed two things: \n  A bachelor's degree... \n  And some experience in teaching\u2014which, for many hopefuls, meant taking a TEFL  (or similar) course before setting sail.\n  You can still go this traditional teaching route, of course.\n  But, if you don't have the qualifications required by most foreign schools...  or you'd like to have more freedom and flexibility in your new life overseas  (and not be restricted by a school's timetable)\u2026 then there's another way...\n  The only requirements are that you speak English... and have a reliable  internet connection.\n  I'm talking about teaching English classes online.\n  John Clites, one of the expats who spoke at our Make Money Overseas Event last  week, told us how he teaches English to students all over the world from his  apartment in Brazil.\nAnd sometimes  from a lounge chair on his patio in Brazil.\n  As John explained for everyone in the room last week, teaching English can be  one of the easiest and best strategies for earning an income overseas:\nYour income potential is solid, at US$15 to US$20 per hour... more       if you settle into a good niche. And, after you sign up a student, you've       put in place a steady income for months or even years. \nThe cost of entry is low. Traditional brick-and-mortar businesses can       require a heavy investment and entail risk. You can get started teaching       English on a shoestring.\nIt really isn't that hard. In fact, it can be a lot of fun. Some       of John's classes involve listening to songs and interpreting the lyrics.       And he's currently reading \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" with       a student. \nYou work from home, so you don't have to go out in bad weather or       deal with traffic or a daily commute.\nBecause you have no commute, you avoid transportation costs and       you don't lose time traveling from student to student.\nYou can schedule consecutive classes without gaps between them,       allowing you to teach more in peak periods. That means higher earnings. \nStudents like online classes, too. Wouldn't you prefer having       class in the comfort of your own home, in a relaxed environment?\nIt's a wonderfully portable profession. You could teach from       wherever you're living right now... or from your new home in Panama, for       example. As long as you have a reasonably decent internet connection,       you're set.\nJohn also told  us that the demand for English teachers is huge and growing. In many parts of  the world, English teachers\u2014especially native speakers\u2014are in very short  supply.\n  Of course, teaching English is just one way to earn an income overseas...\n  In coordinating last week's first-ever Make Money Overseas Event, our team identified 13 strategies for making money  anywhere in the world\u2014in some cases working as little as four or five hours a  week and investing in nothing more than a laptop to get started. \n  Every one of these strategies works for anyone of any age. And they can work  especially well for you if you're:\n  #1: A retiree with some retirement income but not enough to enjoy the  retirement you've long dreamed about.\n  #2: A 40- or 50-something looking to retire early and needing to generate  enough income to carry you through.\n  #3: A younger couple with children, in which case you'll need more substantial  income long term.\n  #4: A 20-something looking for an unconventional global life. If this is you,  our 21st-century world is your playground.\n  Right now, your life slots into one of those paths. \n  The question is:\n  Where do you want to take your life from here? \n  You could move to another country full-time or only part of each year. \n  You could divide your time among two or more countries or you could travel the  globe continuously. \n  You could support this adventure working 40 hours a week or 4. \n  You could embrace the digital nomad lifestyle or set out to build an empire.\n  And you could do any of it anywhere.\n  Kathleen Peddicord\nP.S. If you could live anywhere, where would you most like to  go?\n  And, once there, how would you ideally like to spend your time and make your  money?\n  With the help of the real-life expat entrepreneurs, digital nomads, and  cash-flowing retirees from around the world who convened with us in Las Vegas  last week, we worked hard to find answers to those questions for every Live and  Invest Overseas reader in the room with us.\n  If you weren't with us in person, all is not lost. We got every presentation on  tape... and we're editing those recordings right now to create our new Make Money Overseas: The Home  Conference Kit.\n  In this new program, you'll hear from English teachers, travel writers, online  marketers, importers and exporters, copywriters, bloggers, and vloggers... from  folks running brick-and-mortar businesses around the world... and from others  who don't work at all (they're using passive income opportunities to enjoy true  freedom and embrace their dream lifestyle)...\n  This bundle of more than 30 recordings\u2014including John's session on teaching  English\u2014is currently available at a very special price. As our team works to  neatly tie together all audio recordings, visual materials, and bonus reports,  you can secure your copy for 70% off the regular price. \n  This massive discount expires this Friday, Nov. 9, at midnight. \n  Until then, you can secure your bargain copy of our Make Money Overseas: The  Home Conference Kit here.\n--------------------------------------\nJoin  Us In The World's Top \"Do-Everything\" Overseas Haven For 2018\nThis little country with two long coastlines, one with crashing  Pacific waves and the other with tranquil Caribbean waters, is a top choice  for entrepreneurs thanks to its tax-haven status and its international banking  center.\nPanama City is the hub of all  Latin America, a place where everyone comes to shop modern American-style  malls, do their international banking, and relax (or party it up) on vacation.\nA tropical wonderland with a  cosmopolitan capital, Panama is truly the World's #1 Do-Everything Haven.\nIf you haven't been down here yet  to witness this opportunity for yourself, you need to fix that.\nAnd the best way to find out if  this is a place you want to spend your time is with our help...\nGo here now to learn more. \n         --------------------------------------\nMAILBAG\n \"Kathleen, alright, I'll  bite.

We are also in the process of hiring three new engineers who were interviewed over the past few days. Our new hosting provider is holding up strong, our new domain registrar wrote an incredible blog post showing their support of Gab and free speech, and we are exploring several payment processing options as we speak.\nEpik.com, our new domain registrar, deserves our full support and love right now. They too have been targeted by a mainstream media smear campaign for simply supporting free expression and individual liberty. If you have your domains anywhere else, we'd recommend you transfer them to Epik.com to show your support. If not you can always send them an email or message on their site thanking them for helping keep Gab.com online.\nWe have some critically important information about our Reg CF round. If you invested before this week you'll need to reconfirm your investment via the email that startengine sent out by this Thursday. You can also contact them directly here to reconfirm your investment contact@startengine.com. Others who are interested in investing will be put on a waitlist and be bumped up on Thursday if anyone who has already committed does not reconfirm their investment by then. Please reach out to Startengine if you have any questions on this. It's very important that you do this by this Thursday. \nThank you so much for the continued love and support. \nCEO of Gab\nClick here to login to your account \u2192\nThanks and remember to speak freely!\nunsubscribe\n",

As Stacey said last night, no one should ever be unseen, unheard, or uninspired \u2014 and every single vote should be counted in this race.\nThanks for stepping up again to make history in Georgia.\n\u2014Kamala\n\u201cEvery moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.\u201d\n\u2013 Dolores Huerta\nPAID FOR BY KAMALA HARRIS FOR SENATE\nThis email was sent to morgan@mailinator.com.

To begin to answer these questions, whose\u00a0is the possessive form of the pronoun\u00a0who, while\u00a0who\u2019s\u00a0is a contraction of the words\u00a0who is\u00a0or\u00a0who has. However, many people still find\u00a0whose\u00a0and\u00a0who\u2019s\u00a0particularly confusing because, in English, an apostrophe followed by an s\u00a0usually indicates the possessive form of a word.

On average, individuals can expect to pay $140,000 in long-term care (LTC) costs if they pay out of pocket. A properly designed long term care plan can cover cost associated with receiving care at home, or in an assisted living or nursing home environment. But what if you\u2019re the lucky one who never has a need for care? New insurance plans can ensure that you\u2019re cared for should the need arise, but also that you don\u2019t lose financially if it doesn\u2019t.\nLearn about new insurance plans designed to cover long-term care expenses.

            "msg_body": "Costa Coffee Corporations,Whitbread Court,Houghton Hall Business Park,Dunstable, Bedfordshire.United KingdomLU5 5XEGreetings,My name is Frank Ramsey and i came about your email address through an online email listing. I am the Employment Manager of Costa Coffee, a quality coffee company based in the United Kingdom. Our company has been setup in Lambeth, London since 1971 and we are known for supplying all local caterers, major Italian and American coffee shops around the world with an exciting coffee, slow-roasted the Italian way. People couldn\u2019t get enough of it and by 1978 the first Costa espresso bar opened in Vauxhall Bridge Road here in London.To this day we still use the same method of slow-roasting our coffee beans, serving the brothers authentic blend of 6 Arabica beans to 1 Robusta in coffee shops all over the world. If you're having any doubt, you can check out our website at https://www.costa.co.uk/ . Our company has always faced serious difficulties when it comes to selling out our products to Americans/Canada because they are always offering to pay with US MONEY ORDERS and US CHECKS which has proved difficult for us to cash here in the UK. This became harder for us after the last person that represents us in the US has terminal sickness and cannot continue with the job.WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FOR US?The international money transfer tax for legal entities (companies) in UK is 35%, whereas for the individual it is only 7%. There is no sense for us to work this way, while tax for international money transfer made by a private individual is 7% .That's why we need you! We need agents to receive payment for our coffee ( in money orders, check or bank wire transfers).We are looking for a representative in the United States & Canada who will be working from home on behalf of the company as a Part-Time Representative/Bookkeeper. We are willing to pay 15% for every transaction and of course it wouldn't affect your present job whatsoever. This is a PART-TIME Job and all we need is someone who would help us receive payments from our customers within the states.JOB DESCRIPTION?1. Receive payment from Clients2. Cash Payments at your Bank3. Deduct 15% which will be your percentage/pay on Payment processed.4. Forward balance after deduction of percentage/pay to any of the offices you will be contacted to send payment to Payment is to be forwarded either by Money Gram or Western Union Money Transfer).HOW MUCH WILL YOU EARN?15% from each operation! For instance: you receive $7000 via WIRE TRANSFER on our behalf. You will cash the money and keep $1050 (15% from $7000)for yourself! At the beginning your commission will equal 15%, though later it will increase up to 20% per transaction.ADVANTAGESYou do not have to go out as you will work as an independent contractor right from your home office. Your job is absolutely legal. You can earn up to $3000-$4000 monthly depending on the time you spend for this job. You do not need any capital to start. You can do the Work easily without leaving or affecting your present Job. The employees who make efforts and work hard have a strong possibility to become managers. Anyway our employees never leave us due to our excellent work condition.MAIN REQUIREMENTS:1. Legally capable responsible ready to work 3-4 hours per week PC knowledge2. E-mail and internet experience (minimal) And please know that Everything is absolutely legalWe need someone who is responsible and reliable, someone we could trust with the funds from our sales in the states. Due to the cost of coming to the states and getting payments has been an expensive experience,  our board decided we need a representative in the United State who will be handling the  payment aspect. Note that your duty is to serve as a middle man between Costa Coffee and our customers in the sense that after you receive any payment in form of wire transfer, Checks/Money Orders, you will convert it into cash deduct your 15% and forward the remaining balance to us via our instructions.The transaction charges will be deducted from the company's funds when it's required.

Will you please chip in now?\nDonate A$1 now\nScott,\nIn under\u00a0three weeks we could stop Asahi-Schweppes from bottling up the water of a tiny community in Victoria.\nA brave rural community of 370 is waging a David vs. Goliath battle to fend off a global beverage giant from its water, a resource the residents depend on for their livelihoods.\nThe community has been using this water to grow fruit and nuts for over a century.\nThis fight has brought Stanley to the brink of financial ruin: they were saddled with a $90,000 debt after daring to take the company to court. But incredible SumOfUs members like you stepped in to support the community and your generous donations halved their debt.\nNow with less than 3 weeks before a critical state election, we need to back this tiny town again.\nDecision-makers are at their most vulnerable as they stand for re-election. The more money we raise, the more pressure we can put on decision-makers to come out on the side of Stanley and commit to changing the law.\nOtherwise, there\u2019s nothing stopping companies like Asahi-Schweppes from running the town dry.\nThis is the best chance we have to stop corporations from trampling over community water rights. We really need your support today. Will you please donate A$1?\nThis is what your donation will pay for: we\u2019ll get ads up pressuring key MPs; we\u2019ll mobilise people in constituencies to write to their local papers, and to call and email their representatives; and we\u2019ll do a social media blitz.\nOur country is facing drought. And it\u2019s not the only region or country in the world where this is happening.\nWater is becoming scarcer and more precious by the minute. Water should be protected for communities to use, to drink, and to grow their food.\nYet all across the world, corporations like Nestl\u00e9 and Asahi-Schweppes are getting away with pumping and bottling up pristine water to be sold for profit.\nAnd there\u2019s almost nothing a lot of communities affected by this can do to stop it.\nUntil now.\nWith your support today we can change the game. We can get the law on our side so community water rights come above corporate profit. We only have three weeks to make this happen. Let\u2019s go?\nWill you please donate A$1 to put community water rights over corporate profit?\nAmazing members like you have stood by this little community.\nOver 125,000 of you all around the world signed a petition to Asahi-Schweppes, asking it to stop bottling up the community of Stanley\u2019s water. We delivered your voices straight to the offices of Asahi and they accepted our petition.\nThousands of you chipped in to support the community and you helped halve their debt. Wow, and thank you.\nWe also handed in thousands of powerful messages from members like you, who wrote to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Water Minister Lisa Neville, asking that the law be changed to put water over profit.\nWith the state election around the corner it's time to ramp it up, and that's why we need your support again today to protect rural towns from bottled water giants for good.\nWe only have three weeks! Please donate A$1 to put community water rights over corporate profit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks for all that you do, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKat, Nick, and the team at SumOfUs\nMore information:\nCountry residents take water fight to Melbourne in bid to stop Asahi bottled water extraction, ABC News, 14 October 2018. Victorian town ordered to pay $90,000 after losing bottled water battle with farmer, The Guardian, 30 April 2018. Village residents take their water fight to Asahi head office, Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 2018.\nSumOfUs is a worldwide movement of people like you, working together to hold corporations accountable for their actions and forge a new, sustainable path for our global economy. \nThis email was sent to scott@mailinator.com. | Unsubscribe\n",

            "msg_body": "Costa Coffee Corporations,Whitbread Court,Houghton Hall Business Park,Dunstable, Bedfordshire.United KingdomLU5 5XEGreetings,My name is Frank Ramsey and i came about your email address through an online email listing. I am the Employment Manager of Costa Coffee, a quality coffee company based in the United Kingdom. Our company has been setup in Lambeth, London since 1971 and we are known for supplying all local caterers, major Italian and American coffee shops around the world with an exciting coffee, slow-roasted the Italian way. People couldn\u2019t get enough of it and by 1978 the first Costa espresso bar opened in Vauxhall Bridge Road here in London.To this day we still use the same method of slow-roasting our coffee beans, serving the brothers authentic blend of 6 Arabica beans to 1 Robusta in coffee shops all over the world. If you're having any doubt, you can check out our website at https://www.costa.co.uk/ . Our company has always faced serious difficulties when it comes to selling out our products to Americans/Canada because they are always offering to pay with US MONEY ORDERS and US CHECKS which has proved difficult for us to cash here in the UK. This became harder for us after the last person that represents us in the US has terminal sickness and cannot continue with the job.WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FOR US?The international money transfer tax for legal entities (companies) in UK is 35%, whereas for the individual it is only 7%. There is no sense for us to work this way, while tax for international money transfer made by a private individual is 7% .That's why we need you! We need agents to receive payment for our coffee ( in money orders, check or bank wire transfers).We are looking for a representative in the United States & Canada who will be working from home on behalf of the company as a Part-Time Representative/Bookkeeper. We are willing to pay 15% for every transaction and of course it wouldn't affect your present job whatsoever. This is a PART-TIME Job and all we need is someone who would help us receive payments from our customers within the states.JOB DESCRIPTION?1. Receive payment from Clients2. Cash Payments at your Bank3. Deduct 15% which will be your percentage/pay on Payment processed.4. Forward balance after deduction of percentage/pay to any of the offices you will be contacted to send payment to Payment is to be forwarded either by Money Gram or Western Union Money Transfer).HOW MUCH WILL YOU EARN?15% from each operation! For instance: you receive $7000 via WIRE TRANSFER on our behalf. You will cash the money and keep $1050 (15% from $7000)for yourself! At the beginning your commission will equal 15%, though later it will increase up to 20% per transaction.ADVANTAGESYou do not have to go out as you will work as an independent contractor right from your home office. Your job is absolutely legal. You can earn up to $3000-$4000 monthly depending on the time you spend for this job. You do not need any capital to start. You can do the Work easily without leaving or affecting your present Job. The employees who make efforts and work hard have a strong possibility to become managers. Anyway our employees never leave us due to our excellent work condition.MAIN REQUIREMENTS:1. Legally capable responsible ready to work 3-4 hours per week PC knowledge2. E-mail and internet experience (minimal) And please know that Everything is absolutely legalWe need someone who is responsible and reliable, someone we could trust with the funds from our sales in the states.
