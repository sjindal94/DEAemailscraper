An example of biodegradable pots are ones made of heavy brown paper, cardboard, or peat moss in which young plants for transplanting are grown.\nFor seedling starting in commercial greenhouses or polytunnels, pots usually take the form of trays with cells, each cell acting as one small pot.

The plant can use this water with its roots, as needed. Recently, some flowerpots have been made with an automatic watering system, using a reservoir. Flowerpots have a number of uses such as transporting plants to new locations, starting seeds, patio and indoor cultivation of plants, and the growing of tender plants in colder regions indoors. Through the centuries, the use of flowerpots has influenced the horticultural use of plants, and the Egyptians were among the first to use pots to move plants from one location to another. The Romans brought potted plants inside during cold weather. In the 18th century, pots were used to ship breadfruit seedlings from Tahiti to the West Indies. Also Orchids, African violets and Pelargonium geraniums were shipped in pots from other parts of the world, including Africa, to North America and Europe.\nIn the 18th century, Josiah Wedgwood's flowerpots were as popular as his famous dinner-ware, they were often highly decorative and used as table centrepieces.\nIn Athens, earthenware flowerpots were thrown into the sea during the festival of the Gardens of Adonis. Theophrastus, c. 371 \u2013 c. 287 BC, mentions that a plant called southern-wood was raised and propagated in pots because it was difficult to grow.\nThe top of the flowerpot underneath the rim is commonly known as the shoulder or collar and can aid handling. \n",

Click Here. \nWhy Girls Love Older Guys Who tell Them no..\nleaf and stem components on plants, a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots. The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be bisexual (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the ovary (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least \"ovary inferior\".  The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using the plant's resources, unless they provide some\nother benefit. One proposed reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high degree of specialization. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have\nrequired inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps. Likewise, most fruit used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains. \n",

Thanks in advance!\nFirst, find a gun range near you, most have rentals.

They are generally designed for subcompact and compact handguns since they are easier to conceal. Concealment holsters are designed to be worn under clothing, such as on the belt under a coat, under pants in an ankle holster, or in a trouser pocket. Since the holster is held close to the body, comfort is important, and concealment holsters often have broad surfaces in contact with the user's body, to distribute the pressure across a wider area and prevent abrasion of the skin. Protecting the handgun from the user's perspiration is often an important consideration in such carry locations. Often the outside of the holster is broader, to help break up the outline of the handgun and prevent printing, where the outline of the gun can be seen through clothing. For pocket holsters, the external flat side is often the side with a nap, or rougher surface, to hold the holster in place when drawing the pistol.  Sporting holsters cover a wide spectrum of styles: maximum access for fast draw shooting, highly adjustable holsters used in IPSC and pin shooting, old-fashioned holsters used in Cowboy Action Shooting, high retention, maximum protection holsters used for handgun hunting, and simple holsters used to hold a handgun while out plinking. Like any sporting equipment, sporting holsters evolve to maximize the benefits given the rules of the game, where applicable, so the competitive sports have the most specialized holsters. Holsters for hunting can be unique if they are designed to carry large handguns or to make allowances for telescopic sights. Large handguns are often carried in holsters that are slung across the shoulder, and removed from the body before the handgun is drawn. Slow access is acceptable in this case because the handgun is not expected to be used for defensive purposes.\n",

She'd sit on the cobblestones playing with her  dolls, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends, including, sometimes, our son  Jackson, who was 4 then. They all would chatter and giggle and run around,  little shoes tapping on centuries-old stone...\nLucia's  oldest is now 17, too old to play with dolls, but the past couple of evenings,  as I've prepared dinner for Lief and me, I've listened to her little sister.  Lucia's second child is 10, just young enough to still be interested in Barbie  and to want to sing and dance around our courtyard with her friends.\nBack  in Paris after more than three months away, I'm being reacquainted with these  and other delights of day-to-day life in this city.\nI  suggest often that you frame a vision for your new life in a new country based  on what you'd like to see from your bedroom window each morning.\nThink  also about what you'd like to hear outside it.\nOne  of the things I most appreciate about Paris is how cyclical this city can be.  Parisians move through life in reliable ways. Depending on the time of year and  the time of day, you can predict both the scene outside your window and the  sounds that go along with it.\nFrom  the bedroom of our apartment in Paris' 7th arrondissement the view is of the white-stone facades of classic 18th-century Parisian  townhouses. Up and down both sides of the street we see oversized shuttered  windows, ornate black iron railings, and iron lanterns hung at regular  intervals.\nIt's  a nice view, but more memorable for me are the sounds of our little corner of the  City of Light...\nEvery  morning the wine bottles from the previous night's trade at the restaurant down  the street are dumped, in one fell swoop, into the collection bin, which passes  by at 10 a.m. precisely. The resulting crash of glass on glass reverberates  through the neighborhood. For some reason, this sound sticks with me and makes  me smile when I think of it, as I do often, when I'm elsewhere in the world.\nOnce  a month the knife sharpener passes down our street. You know he's coming when  you hear the ding of the bell attached to the wooden handle of the trolley  carrying his grind stone. Not many tradesman knife sharpeners left in Paris, so  we take ours our kitchen knives for his attention every time he passes by.\nAnd  all day long we hear our French neighbors greeting each other in passing, in  the courtyard and on the street out front... bonjour...  comment \u00e7a va?... \u00e7a va bien, merci!... et vous?... they call out cheerfully.\nWe've  returned to Paris after several weeks at Los Islotes, the beachfront community  we're undertaking on Panama's  Pacific coast. We have ocean views from  every room of the house we've built here, but the one from our bedroom window stands  out. Lying in bed we see, in one direction, the deep blue Pacific and, turning  our heads, the lush green hillsides of this Veraguas coast. Very different from  the views here in Paris.\nAnd,  instead of children dancing on cobblestones, wine bottles crashing on  collection, and neighbors calling out in greeting, at home at Los Islotes we  hear the capuchin monkeys who like to hang out in the black walnut trees that  grow alongside the swimming pool, the occasional toucan, and the crash of the  surf.\nWe  appreciate both scenes and, most of all, the contrast between the two.\nIf  you could hear any sound from outside your bedroom window each morning, what would  you most like it to be...\nKathleen Peddicord \n--------------------------------------\nWelcoming,  Safe, Exotic, And Absurdly Cheap\nDine out every day of  the week... twice a day if you like.\n  Why  not? When you can enjoy a nice dinner for just a few dollars, including wine  and dessert...\nAnd  a tasty, hearty lunch, all you can eat, costs 50 cents!\nHave  an hour-long massage. Heck, have one every afternoon. The cost is US$10...\nEngage  full-time help around the house. Plus a gardener, too. Never wash another dish  or pull another weed.\nRent  a fully furnished condo for a few hundred dollars a month...\nOr  a place that qualifies as all-out luxury, with every modern convenience and  amenity, for perhaps US$100 or US$200 per month more...\nGo  here now for more details. \n         --------------------------------------\n      P.S.  What else this week?\nWorking freelance overseas doesn't have to mean  isolation...\n\"Will you work from a home office...  or perhaps in a lounge chair poolside of your new residence?\n  \"Will you rent space... or maybe invest in an office of your own?\n  \"Or will you share space?\n  \"Today's gig economy has spawned a global industry of co-working options...\"\nHave a laptop, internet connection, and the ability to speak  English? Start earning money overseas now... \n\"John Clites, one of the expats who  spoke at our Make Money Overseas Event last week, told us how he teaches  English to students all over the world from his apartment in Brazil.\n  \"And sometimes from a lounge chair on his patio in Brazil.\n  \"As John explained for everyone in the room last week, teaching English can be  one of the easiest and  best strategies for earning an income overseas...\"\nPut your new life first... the cash flow  to support it second... \n\"In today's world, it is easier than  it's ever been to go where you want and have the money follow, regardless of  your schooling, experience, age, budget, or any other circumstances.\n  \"So I say this to you now: \n  \"Imagine the life you want for yourself... and then make a plan for earning an  income in the place where  you really want to be...\"\nFrom online tickets to organic cacao, this is one sweet journey... \n\"In Colombia, the chime til\u00edn-til\u00edn, til\u00edn-til\u00edn of the bell on the horse-drawn carriage still announces  the arrival of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other products in small towns...  as it has for centuries.\n  \"Just as the horse-drawn carriage connects Colombia's hidden villages to other  areas of the country, today Til\u00edn Cacao is connecting the world to Colombian cacao and chocolate...\"\nLet your go-overseas plan develop organically\u2014this idea is infinitely customizable... \n\"The first and perhaps most  important step you must take to make sure that you arrive where you want to be  in your new life overseas is to understand what, really, you want your new life  overseas to be.\n  \"What's important to you? What are your priorities? Your agendas? Your  preferences?\n  \"What are you not willing to give up from your current lifestyle... and what would make you miserable in  your new one?...\"\nPlus, From Founding Publisher  Kathleen Peddicord: All The Money You Need To Fund The New  Life Overseas You Dream Of... No Work Required?...\nIn your new life overseas, you could  support yourself by going to work for someone else... but who wants a J-O-B?\nBetter to make your own money and control  your own schedule.\nAt last week's Make Money Overseas Event we explored dozens of options for generating  self-directed income as an expat or retiree abroad...\nYou could be a consultant, coaching,  mentoring, or tutoring others interested in acquiring skills you hold thanks to  years or decades of professional experience in the developed world...\nYou could be a freelance travel writer... a  copywriter... a blogger... or a vlogger...\nYou could import or export... market or sell  online... manage rental properties... or start a food-processing business (we met  one expat-entrepreneur last week who is making a business of habanero onion  sauce in Cayo, Belize, using his own recipe and ingredients he grows on his  farm)...\nYou could teach English, either online or  in person... lead tours... or open a dance studio...\nOr you could choose not to work at all,  not for someone else and not for yourself either.\nIf you have a little available capital,  you could invest to create a passive income stream from turnkey real estate  opportunities in top markets.\nThe new life overseas you're dreaming of...  no work required?\nYes, it's possible.\nAt last week's event, multimillionaire  global property investor Lief Simon walked us through it.\n\"When making a passive-income plan for  supporting yourself overseas, consider three factors,\" Lief advised the group.\n\"First, how much income do you need to  live the life you want to live in the place where you want to be?\n\"Second, in what currency(ies) will you  have expenses?\n\"Third, how much risk can you live with?\n\"Comfortable with your response to those  questions,\" Lief continued, \"next, look at your options for generating passive  income. They boil down to two:\nRental Property\nTurnkey  Agriculture\n\"After decades of experience with these  strategies,\" Lief said, \"I favor agriculture. It's the one way I've found to  generate good or excellent income over an extended period of time (up to 30  years or longer) with zero effort. Once you've made the initial investment, you  can sit back and wait for your dividend payments.\n\"Right now,\" Lief continued, \"I like four  turnkey agriculture options in particular:\nFruit trees (Right  now I'm keenest on mangos...)\nAquaponics \nTruffles (I think of truffles as agricultural gold...)\nTimber \nEach option has its pluses and its  minuses, which Lief laid out for the group, as follows:\nFruit Tree Plantations\nPros:\nYou own the land\nCan provide cash  flow for at least 40 years\nNo foreign taxes\nReturns of up to  18% per year\nDollar-based,  meaning no currency exchange risk\nCons:\nYou have to wait  up to four years before receiving your first payout\nPayouts are annual \nDollar-based,  meaning no potential currency upside\nAquaponics\nPros:\nYou own the  equipment\nYou can receive  your initial cash returns in as little as 18 months\nBiannual revenue  payouts\nFlexible  production options to maximize revenue\nReturns of up to  14.5% per year\nThai baht-based  revenue, meaning you could enjoy additional upside if the currency moves in  your favor \nCons:\nThai baht-based  revenue, meaning the currency could go against you\nTruffles\nPros:\nTwo to three years  before first harvest and payout\nLuxury product  with expanding demand well beyond global production levels\nNo foreign taxes  for 15 years\nReturns of up to  19% or more per year\nEuro-based  revenue, meaning you could enjoy additional upside if the currency moves in  your favor\nCons:\nPayouts are annual\nDifficult to  predict future prices\nEuro-based  revenue, meaning the currency could go against you\nTimber\nPros:\nYou own the land\nGreat choice for  long-term legacy planning\nReturns of up to  16% per year\nCons:\nGrowth cycle is  years, and the payout isn't until trees are harvested\nDifficult to  predict future prices \nThanks for reading  Overseas Opportunity Letter, a free daily email service brought to you six days a week by Live and Invest Overseas publications.

I feel great and just wanted to thank you for the improvement you have made in the quality of my life.\nA flowerpot, flower pot, or plant pot is a container in which flowers and other plants are cultivated and displayed. Historically, and still to a significant extent today, they are made from terracotta. Flowerpots are now often also made from plastic, wood, stone, or sometimes biodegradable material. An example of biodegradable pots are ones made of heavy brown paper, cardboard, or peat moss in which young plants for transplanting are grown.\nFor seedling starting in commercial greenhouses or polytunnels, pots usually take the form of trays with cells, each cell acting as one small pot. These trays are often called flats.\nThere are often holes in the bottom of pots, to allow excess water to flow out, sometimes to a saucer that is placed under the flowerpot. The plant can use this water with its roots, as needed. Recently, some flowerpots have been made with an automatic watering system, using a reservoir. Flowerpots have a number of uses such as transporting plants to new locations, starting seeds, patio and indoor cultivation of plants, and the growing of tender plants in colder regions indoors. Through the centuries, the use of flowerpots has influenced the horticultural use of plants, and the Egyptians were among the first to use pots to move plants from one location to another. The Romans brought potted plants inside during cold weather. In the 18th century, pots were used to ship breadfruit seedlings from Tahiti to the West Indies. Also Orchids, African violets and Pelargonium geraniums were shipped in pots from other parts of the world, including Africa, to North America and Europe.\nIn the 18th century, Josiah Wedgwood's flowerpots were as popular as his famous dinner-ware, they were often highly decorative and used as table centrepieces.\nIn Athens, earthenware flowerpots were thrown into the sea during the festival of the Gardens of Adonis. Theophrastus, c. 371 \u2013 c. 287 BC, mentions that a plant called southern-wood was raised and propagated in pots because it was difficult to grow.\nThe top of the flowerpot underneath the rim is commonly known as the shoulder or collar and can aid handling. \n",

            "msg_body": "End Gutter Cleaning for life\nHeating or electricity is one of the most considerable costs in the operation of greenhouses across the globe, especially in colder climates. The main problem with heating a greenhouse as opposed to a building that has solid opaque walls is the amount of heat lost through the greenhouse covering. Since the coverings need to allow light to filter into the structure, they conversely cannot insulate very well. With traditional plastic greenhouse coverings having an R-value of around 2, a great amount of money is therefore spent to continually replace the heat lost. Most greenhouses, when supplemental heat is needed use natural gas or electric furnaces.  Passive heating methods exist which seek heat using low energy input. Solar energy can be captured from periods of relative abundance (day time/summer), and released to boost the temperature during cooler periods (night time/winter). Waste heat from livestock can also be used to heat greenhouses, e.g., placing a chicken coop inside a greenhouse recovers the heat generated by the chickens, which would otherwise be wasted.[citation needed] Some greenhouses also rely on geothermal heating. Cooling is typically done by opening windows in the greenhouse when it gets too warm for the plants inside it. This can be done manually, or in an automated manner. Window actuators can open windows due to temperature difference or can be opened by electronic controllers. Electronic controllers are often used to monitor the temperature and adjusts the furnace operation to the conditions. This can be as simple as a basic thermostat, but can be more complicated in larger greenhouse operations. \n",

The most primitive flowers are thought to have had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers would have tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be bisexual (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the ovary (female part). As flowers grew more advanced, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant, or at least \"ovary inferior\".  The general assumption is that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve animals in the reproduction process. Pollen can be scattered without bright colors and obvious shapes, which would therefore be a liability, using the plant's resources, unless they provide some\nother benefit. One proposed reason for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowers is that they evolved in an isolated setting like an island, or chain of islands, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example), the way many island species develop today. This symbiotic relationship, with a hypothetical wasp bearing pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could have eventually resulted in both the plant(s) and their partners developing a high degree of specialization. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation, especially when it comes to radical adaptations which seem to have\nrequired inferior transitional forms. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, apparently evolved specifically for symbiotic plant relationships, are descended from wasps. Likewise, most fruit used in plant reproduction comes from the enlargement of parts of the flower. This fruit is frequently a tool which depends upon animals wishing to eat it, and thus scattering the seeds it contains. \n",

Shoot a bunch off, figure out which one you like (try a .38), then take a class or two and learn what you need to know about firearms.\nI'd suggest a hand gun that can be carried outside the home because it can do double duty.\nDo whatever it takes to get a carry permit.

They are generally designed for subcompact and compact handguns since they are easier to conceal. Concealment holsters are designed to be worn under clothing, such as on the belt under a coat, under pants in an ankle holster, or in a trouser pocket. Since the holster is held close to the body, comfort is important, and concealment holsters often have broad surfaces in contact with the user's body, to distribute the pressure across a wider area and prevent abrasion of the skin. Protecting the handgun from the user's perspiration is often an important consideration in such carry locations. Often the outside of the holster is broader, to help break up the outline of the handgun and prevent printing, where the outline of the gun can be seen through clothing. For pocket holsters, the external flat side is often the side with a nap, or rougher surface, to hold the holster in place when drawing the pistol.  Sporting holsters cover a wide spectrum of styles: maximum access for fast draw shooting, highly adjustable holsters used in IPSC and pin shooting, old-fashioned holsters used in Cowboy Action Shooting, high retention, maximum protection holsters used for handgun hunting, and simple holsters used to hold a handgun while out plinking. Like any sporting equipment, sporting holsters evolve to maximize the benefits given the rules of the game, where applicable, so the competitive sports have the most specialized holsters. Holsters for hunting can be unique if they are designed to carry large handguns or to make allowances for telescopic sights. Large handguns are often carried in holsters that are slung across the shoulder, and removed from the body before the handgun is drawn. Slow access is acceptable in this case because the handgun is not expected to be used for defensive purposes.\n",
