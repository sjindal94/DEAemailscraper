In addition to some unnamed angel investors, funds came from Foundation Capital, Baseline Ventures, Google Ventures, and Founder Collective. The company rejected an acquisition offer by Evernote after showing concerns that Evernote intended to shut down the Read It Later service and amalgamate its functionality into Evernote's main service. Initially a free and a paid version\u2014including additional features\u2014of the Read It Later app were available. After the rebranding to Pocket, all paid features were made available in a free and advertisement-free app. In May 2014, a paid subscription service called Pocket Premium was introduced, adding server side storage of articles and more powerful search tools. In June 2015, Pocket integration was added as a default feature to the Mozilla Firefox web browser, via a toolbar button and link to a user's Pocket list in the bookmarks menu. The integration was controversial, as users displayed concerns for the direct integration of a proprietary service into an open source application, and that it could not be completely disabled without editing advanced settings, unlike third-party extensions. A Mozilla spokesperson stated that the feature was meant to leverage the service's popularity among Firefox users and clarified that all code related to the integration was open source. The spokesperson added that \"[Mozilla had] gotten lots of positive feedback about the integration from users\". On February 27, 2017, Pocket announced that it had been acquired by Mozilla Corporation, the commercial arm of Firefox's non-profit development group. Mozilla staff stated that Pocket would continue to operate as an independent subsidiary but that it would be leveraged as part of an ongoing \"Context Graph\" project. There are plans to open-source the server-side code of Pocket but that has yet to materialize as of September 2018.\n",

Spreads are added to food to enhance the flavor or texture of the food, which may be considered bland without it. Spread food products are prepared in a paste, syrup, or liquid Toasting is a common method of making stale bread more palatable. Bread is often toasted using a toaster, but toaster ovens are also used. Though many types of bread can be toasted the most commonly used is \"sliced bread\", referring to bread that is already sliced and bagged upon purchase and may be white, brown, or multigrain When buttered, toast may also be served as an accompaniment to savoury dishes, especially soups or stews, or topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or baked beans as a light meal. Toast is a common breakfast food. While slices of bread are most common, bagels and English muffins are also toasted. Scientific studies in the early 2000s found that toast may contain carcinogens caused by the browning process\n",

What they\u2019ve put together is solid research as well as exciting,\u201d Snyder told Healthline.Knowing how tau may assemble into tangles is essential to developing treatments.\u201cThere are things that need to happen before we get to a solution,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cUnderstanding biology is key.\u201dShe also stresses the need for federal funding.\u201cThis work is so valuable and needs to continue. And the Alzheimer\u2019s Association is a leader in that conversation,\u201d she said.\u201cThe hunt is on to build on this finding and make a treatment that blocks the neurodegeneration process where it begins,\u201d Diamond added. \u201cIf it works, the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease could be substantially reduced. That would be aing.\u201dStudying tau Diamond\u2019s lab, at the forefront of many notable findings relating to tau, previously determined that tau acts like a prion \u2014 an infectious protein that can spread like a virus through the brain.The tau protein in the human brain can form many distinct strains, or self-replicating structures. The team has developed methods to reproduce that phenomenon in the laboratory.Diamond says his newest research indicates that a single pathological form of tau protein may have multiple possible shapes, each associated with a different form of dementia.He hopes the scientific field can use the new findings to help identify the genesis of the disease.They have a viral target in diagnosing the condition at an early stage before the symptoms of memory loss and cognitive decline become apparent, he says.Next on his agenda is for the team to develop a simple clinical test that examines a person\u2019s blood or spinal fluid to detect the first biological signs of the abnormal tau protein.But just as important, Diamond says, efforts are underway to develop a treatment that would make the diagnosis the basis for useful intervention.He cites a compelling reason for cautious optimism: Tafamidis, a drug recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, stabilizes a different shape-shifting protein called transthyretin that causes deadly protein accumulation in the heart, similar to how tau overwhelms the brain.The hope is that someday gray hair will become older adults\u2019 biggest worry about their head.\n",

More studies are looking at whether using probiotics to alter your gut microbiome can reduce symptoms of mental illness. Researchers are learning how the gut affects the brain. Illustration by Brittany England. Ashley Abramson was 10 years old when she received a diagnosis of anxiety and an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Since then, she\u2019s taken an antidepressant in various forms and doses almost every single day for two decades. In recent years, though, this mom-writer hybrid from Minneapolis, Minnesota, has shifted toward a more holistic approach. In addition to her medications, she\u2019s tried herbal and vitamin supplements, chiropractic adjustments, and visits to a naturopath to see if they can also help lessen her symptoms.

Courtesy of DC Moore Gallery,\nNew York\nWeekly Recommendations\nDuane Michals \nCrocker Art Museum\nAdrian Piper\nHammer Museum\nBelkis Ay\u00f3n\nScottsdale MOCA\nWhitney Bradshaw\nDePaul Art Museum\nMeleko Mokgosi\nHonor Fraser\nDuane Michals\nCrocker Art Museum,\nSacramento, California \nby DeWitt Cheng\nContinuing through January 6, 2019\nIt's an era of celebrity worship \u2014 and, with Instagram selfies, of equal opportunity self-aggrandizement \u2014 so the timing of this large exhibition of Duane Michals' photographic portraits of our cultural royalty, with a few commoner friends and relatives thrown in, could not be better timed. \"Portraits,\" curated by Linda Benedict-Jones and presented by Curatorial Assistance Traveling Exhibitions, features more than 125 photos \"recently discovered by the artist in his New York apartment.\" Old and young familiar faces of musicians, actors, artists and writers appear, but seen in unfamiliar ways: personally, and idiosyncratically interpreted.\nMichals, born in 1932, is a self-taught photographer with a long career photographing for publications. He came to art-world notice in the early 1970s with \"Sequences,\" a book of narrative sequences of staged/posed photos that married age-old themes of youth, love, loss, old age, death and transfiguration to the spare\u2026\u00a0READ MORE \nEditors' Roundtable\nby Matthew Kangas\nAlthough Portland has one stand-alone art museum as opposed to Seattle's three and San Francisco's four, Portland Art Museum's Met-like expansions along the Park Blocks (their Central Park) retained Pietro Belluschi's classic Roman travertine and Mussolini-style red brick building. A Masonic lodge nearby was annexed and turned into a four-story repository for, among other things, the personal collection of art critic Clement Greenberg; the Evan Roberts 20th-century sculpture collection; and a cinemath\u00e8que unparalleled north of Berkeley.\nPortland has always had its own unique virtues. A river town on the convergence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers, it grew earlier and wealthier than its territorial sisters, Seattle and Tacoma. Victorian merchants donated astonishing examples of French and Italian Mannerist and Baroque art, now highlighted by a recently acquired Neapolitan rarity by Giuseppe Bonito, \"Il Femminiello\" (1740), capturing two young men from Naples' wholly accepted subculture of cross dressers. The made-up, dressed-up teenager and his admirer comically distort a mirror of gender identity and sexual transactions.\nIt could take days to properly cover and appreciate PAM's total conglomeration in two and one-half buildings on five floors. Take the kids to see Courbet's \"Stormy Sea\" (1869) and they will want to return next Saturday, maybe to see \"Mount Hood\" (1910) by Childe Hassam, the ultimate American Impressionist view of a Northwest peak. The entire American floor puts the Seattle-centered regional narrative that privileges the influence of Asian spirituality into serious question.\nThanks to the smooth insertion of intimate (and one gigantic)-scale Greenberg bequests of Frankenthaler, Olitski, Poons and, above all, David Smith, and the context downstairs of European forerunners like Rodin, Matisse and others, PAM's modern galleries are now unequalled in the region. What they lack of Seattle's abstract expressionist and Pop art icons, they make up for with Color Field, Minimalist and Conceptualist treasures, with strong emphasis on sculpture and photography.\nOne-half block from PAM, Michael Parsons Fine Art shares a street-level storefront in an historic landmark building. First of three radically different ceramics shows I saw, \"Mid-century Northwest Ceramics\" broke no new scholarly ground but, after all, is a blend of two collections, not a museum event. Pottery collectors and specialists will want to see these minor examples of major Northwest ceramists such as Robert Sperry, David Shaner and Marie Louise Feldenheimer.\nJeffry Mitchell is a Seattle-based artist working in glazed earthenware, stoneware and porcelain among many other materials. He is hyper-aware of art-historical examples of ceramics, his work cramming everything except a porcelain sink into his current PDX Contemporary exhibition. Chinese fu dogs, lions, bears and other animals and queer symbols cover the two dozen sculptures, prints and drawings. Everything is drenched in a filmy, milky white monochrome with pink, green, blue and yellow seeping through. With heavily added-onto vases and pots, Mitchell mixes Japanese pottery (where he apprenticed for years) with Italian and French faience, Tudor jug-ware and Southern redneck plaques. Insects, toy animals and little people all converge on the teeming surfaces. \nAcross town in a ceramics production-ware factory, Eutectic Gallery completes the necklace of clay shows by updating ceramics' historical illusionistic aspect. \"Factitious Matter\" debuts a quartet of ceramic and glass artists using mostly casting and molding techniques to simulate cheesy consumer products such as plastic water bottles and cardboard packing materials. Although immaculately crafted, as is usual with trompe l'oeil, what little humor there is can quickly evaporate \u2014 and date \u2014 if not going beyond the predictable visual pun or one-liner.\nBack downtown in the historic Pearl District, a core of reliable galleries present art to the city's burgeoning middle class of functionaries and executives working at Intel, Nike and Adidas, the top local employers. At 90, George Johanson is celebrating his fourth major retrospective since 1988. A local Museum Art School grad, he went off to New York and London before returning to teach in 1955. Responsible for generations of similar figurative expressionists, Johanson, as seen here, is much more. With 40 works drawn from the artist's collection, we get an unusual insight into a more varied and light-filled modernist's world than heretofore granted by this critic.\nPerpetuating Johanson's flair for narrative-figurative painting, current Portland State University teacher Ralph Pugay, showing at Upfor Gallery, builds on Mexican-influenced Filipino devotional art and scenes of community festivals. Extreme mood contrasts of light and dark flow out of Spanish art, via Mexico. Mexican-born Victor Maldonado (another local professor) breaks through to larger, energetic figurative abstractions at Froelick Gallery. Vigorously scratched and daubed networks of webbing and lines conceal crouching figures and (more) animals.\nMost austere and heartening among the current shows, at Charles Hartman Fine Art, John Whitten (who teaches digital art at Oregon State), simulates digital strategies \u2014 but makes each colored-pencil drawing by hand. Thousands of lines comprise each work, varying from dizzying vertical fields to sunburst targets. The 15 works are a shift from earlier more representational works and a welcome sign of a further possible differentiation by local artists away from Johanson & Company's long reign of figurative expressionism.\n [The Editor's Roundtable is a column of commentary by our own editors and guest columnists from around the region.

She's the quintessential institutional artist, to the extent that her work tends to defy market collectability, though it's widely valued by museums for its social poignancy and its ability to reflect the zeitgeist of virtually every decade of her long career.\nAs a sign of \"Concepts and Intuitions, 1965-2016\" comprehensiveness, as well as Piper's ability to make quality, relevant work from early in her career, the show begins with LSD-driven drawings and paintings from when she was still a teenager.

Only men are initiated into the Abaku\u00e1 Secret Society, which is part religion and part fraternal organization, although its mythology includes a woman named Sik\u00e1n who figures prominently in the artist's work. This retrospective reveals Ay\u00f3n's careful study of this mythology, and her facility for moving deftly within and beyond it. \nOver time, Ay\u00f3n moves from representing key elements of the Abaku\u00e1 myth to incorporating symbolism from other religions such as Catholicism. She creates not only a fish that's central to the secret society's lore, but human figures covered in fish scales. She begins to blur the boundary between Sik\u00e1n's form\u2026\u00a0READ MORE\nWhitney Bradshaw\nDePaul University Museum, Chicago, Illinois\nby Robin Dluzen\nContinuing through December 16, 2018\n\"Outcry,\" a photo series by Chicago artist Whitney Bradshaw, has been ongoing since the January 2018 Women's March, depicting a diverse range of women captured mid-scream in the artists studio.

View this email on the web.\n \u00a0November 10, 2018 \nMasada: Still surrendering its secrets to scholars today\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis BAS Special Collection takes you beyond the made-for-Hollywood drama you already know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou might think that the world knows everything there is to know about Masada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter all, the legendary Herodian pleasure-palace sits in one of the most dramatic settings in the world. Its history includes the even more dramatic Roman siege that ended with the occupying Zealots, Jewish rebels, committing mass suicide, rather than live out their lives as Roman slaves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd millions of visitors travel to this renowned Israeli national park every year. Yet there are many aspects of Masada that are still unknown even to the most enthusiastic scholar\u2014and more as yet undiscovered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile the moving story of rebellion and brave resistance by a small native group against the mighty Roman Empire is naturally most appealing to modern ears, there are equally intriguing aspects that are often overlooked from the other side of the story\u2014the Roman point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd perhaps you\u2019ve even read the Bible History Daily article that\u2019s one of the most widely-read among the Biblical Archaeology Society\u2019s members: \u201cThe Masada Siege: The Roman assault on Herod\u2019s desert fortress.\u201d\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou may have marveled at the details about the Roman siege that we\u2019ve discovered through archaeology:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 2.5-mile, 5-foot wide, 10-foot high circumvallation wall that the Romans built around the fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe 15 towers that lined the eastern and northern stretches of the circumvallation wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe great assault ramp that the Romans threw up on the western flank of the mountain, the most conspicuous surviving evidence of the siege.\nDigging deeper into the true story of Masada\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut there is so much beyond these glimpses into the distant past. From Biblical Archaeology Review, we learn that the wall, while a fairly common tactic in Roman siege warfare, was unusual in the difficulty of the terrain that the Romans managed to cross with it.\nBecome a Member\u00a0Now and Save 80%!\nExplore the world\u2019s most intriguing Biblical scholarship\nDig into more than 7,000 articles in the Biblical Archaeology Society\u2019s vast library, plus much more\u00a0with an All-Access pass.\nYES, I want my All-Access\u00a0pass! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe learn that the Roman operation probably included some 7,000 to 10,000 men, some of them ancillary troops from other nations within the Empire\u2014all arrayed against a mere 960 Jews holed up inside the fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe learn that the Romans went to the trouble and expense of importing wood to the encampment for their building projects, and had multiple camps, including two that spread over five acres each.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe discover the bitterly ironic fact that the troops staring up at Masada for months had been forged and trained in the architecture of warfare by their earlier experiences in putting down the Zealots\u2019 fellow rebels over the previous three years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd above all, we learn from studying the remains of the Roman encampments and siege structures that such relentless pursuit of a monolithic building scheme\u2014even at the expense of strict military necessity\u2014suggests that the Romans were consciously adopting a form of psychological warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Jewish rebels inside their fortress high above the Roman encampment would have known that they were, finally, totally isolated, with no hope of relief or escape. Even more, other restless subject nations would readily understand the message that they could never resist Roman might.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYet this sobering reflection on what the Jews of the first century faced is still only a fraction of what we\u2019ve learned about Masada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe know how Herod initially managed to create a pleasure palace, complete with baths and gardens, in the middle of the desert.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe know how the Romans managed to build what appears to be the most massive attack ramp in the ancient world in a matter of weeks, instead of months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe know that there are still unexplored caves within the site, some of which are still to be explored in coming months.\nBecome a Member\u00a0Now and Save 80%!\nExplore the world\u2019s most intriguing Biblical scholarship\nDig into more than 7,000 articles in the Biblical Archaeology Society\u2019s vast library, plus much more\u00a0with an All-Access pass.\nYES, I want my All-Access\u00a0pass! \nDiscovering everything scholars know today about Masada\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps the most interesting thing about Masada is that it has taken the work not just of archaeologists but also of geologists, historians, and other scholars to piece together the full picture of an event that took place almost 2,000 years ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd all of this is presented to students of Masada in an exciting Special Collection of the very best BAS material: Masada.

When accompanied by pain, these noises are often one of the first warning signs of devastating cartilage loss.\nCartilage loss happens as you age, which makes joint pain worse over time. In some cases, your cartilage can break down in less than a year, which can cause extreme pain1.  \nAs joints become more damaged, patients often find themselves stuck in bed or a wheelchair.\nToday, joint pain is one of the leading causes of disability and nursing home placement. With the occurrence of joint problems doubling since the 1950s, older adults are increasingly concerned about losing their independence2.\nWhy is this happening and what can you do to protect your joints from crumbling away?\nThe answer might surprise you.\nIf you've listened to medical experts, you may believe that joint problems are caused by \"wear and tear\" or aging.\nBut new research suggests age-related joint decay is not caused by wear-and-tear... and it might even be preventable!\nWhat's more, experts now say aging joints can be restored back to their youthful function. How is this possible? According to scientists, \"joint lubrication\" appears to be the solution.\nDr. Daniel Lieberman, a professor at Harvard University, was one of the first to discover that joint problems weren't necessarily caused by aging.\nIn 2017, Dr. Lieberman traveled across America looking for an answer to the rise of joint pain amongst seniors.\nHis journey took him through vast museums and state-of-the-art medical centers. In his travels, Dr. Lieberman examined prehistoric skeletons as old as 4,000 years.\nAnd what he discovered was so astonishing that doctors may now change how they treat joint problems.\nIn a recent interview, Dr. Richard Loeser, a Rheumatologist at the University of North Carolina says Dr. Lieberman's discovery makes perfect sense3.\n\"Your joints aren't just like your automobile tires that wear out as you use them,\" says Dr. Loeser.\nWhen asked if it was ever too late to fix damaged joints, Dr. Loeser went on to state \"No, no, it's not too late ... by stimulating your cartilage [you] can still improve the health of your joints.\"\nThis is certainly great news for anyone with creaky joints who believe they're doomed to sound like the Tin Man from Wizard Oz.\nRELATED: Amazing seniors that bike, run marathons, and weight train without pain. What's their secret? It's not surgery or pain pills! Find out here.\nMoreover, there are now over a dozen scientific studies that appear to support Dr. Lieberman's incredible findings. In fact, researchers at Stanford University came to a similar conclusion in 2011 when investigating the role of aging in joint problems4.  According to the researchers, \"wear and tear\" does not lead to joint problems!\nWhat's most exciting of all are the number of seniors who are now throwing away their pain pills for safer and more effective alternatives. People in their 40s, 50s, 60s, and beyond are switching to treatments that are natural and free of side-effects.\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial published in the International Journal of Medical Science, one natural joint fix was able to erase joint pain within 5 days5.  \nAnd in yet another study performed at Harvard University Medical School, patients with swollen and tender joints experienced significant relief after trying a similar natural joint remedy6.  \nThe natural treatments used in both studies work to support the fluid found within your joints, which promotes increased flexibility and more comfort. \nIn other words, joint lubrication could be a miracle for those who suffer from achy joints.\nSo what exactly are these seniors using to stop their joint pain so quickly? And what did Dr. Lieberman discover? To find out, click here and watch the free presentation now...\n\tReferences:\n1 Bounty, N, Paul C, Leroy X, Fredoux D, Migaud H, Cotten A.

You know building a writing habit is one of the best things you can do for your life and career.\n               But \n               what in the world do you write \n               about?\nHow do you get the words to flow?\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to know what to write about every time you sat down? Imagine one blog post, newsletter, video topic, or podcast flowing into the next. Each pieces connects to the one after it.\nEverything you write fits together and tells a story.\nYour reader, your viewer, your listener is pulled along. They can't stop reading!\nNo more scrambling at the last minute to come up with a topic.\nThis is the power of an editorial calendar.\nYou come up your one major theme by answering 4 questions.\nI teach you how to make your own editorial calendar in this training so you can create 5 months of content in 5 minutes.\nFigure out who you\u2019re writing for.\nDiscover what they want.\nReverse engineer the outcome.\nLearn to list the steps, break them down, and expand everything into a series!\nIt\u2019s beautiful to see it all come together in such a short amount of time.\nMake sure to watch the training replay video today before it expires tomorrow.\nWatch Replay\n(Replay video expires in 24 hours.)\nSean McCabe\nP.S.\nWriting is the KEY. The moment you build a daily writing habit is the moment you will look back and say, \u201cThis is where everything changed for me.\u201d\n30 Days to Better Writing will help you build a writing habit in 30 days.\nThe entire training I did on creating your editorial calendar was based on just ONE of 30 lessons from 30 Days to Better Writing.\nThe 30 Days to Better Writing course is FREE for seanwes members.\nThis course will change your life. 30 Days to Better Writing is primarily about developing a writing habit, but I\u2019ve found as I\u2019ve shown up every day and committed to writing, I can do this with any other habit in my life.\n30 Days to Better Writing has been so fantastic for me. It has helped me \n               clarify my vision and goals for my work, find what to write about, develop ideas for courses, books, emails, blog posts, podcasts and so much more.\nThis course provides you tools to form good habits, and good habits can change your life.\nMy list now has topics for a solid month out of where I\u2019m writing. \n               I\u2019ll never run out of topics to write ever again!\nNow that I\u2019ve finished this 30 days and successfully developed a writing habit, \n               I feel confident that I can start other habits that may not even have anything to do with writing. This course helped me see that. I\u2019ve also really pressed into writing being the source of everything. I now find myself taking time to write more before starting other projects. This gives me a better start and helps me form more concrete ideas before I begin.\nTotal words written: 40,030\n\u2013 Alex Sawyer\nP.P.S.\nOh, hi!

Before I do, I want to take a quick moment and explain the situation in Florida right now. This is important.\nRight now, Bill Nelson trails by roughly 15,000 votes \u2014 only .18% of the total votes cast with many more to be counted.\nAs the race continues to narrow, Republicans have gone on the attack by fabricating stories about voter fraud and intimidating local election officials. This is beginning to resemble the 2000 recount fight in Florida \u2014 and we can\u2019t let that happen again.\nThe truth is, this process is going to cost millions of dollars \u2014 and Bill\u2019s opponent is a self-funding millionaire who has already spent tens of millions of his own personal wealth to buy this race. How much do you think he\u2019s going to spend to try and win this thing now that it\u2019s this close?\nBill has assembled a smart team of lawyers. Some of the best in the business when it comes to recounts and election law. If they have the resources to counter Republicans in this fight, they can ensure every vote is counted.\nI am personally asking you to add a donation of $10 or more to Senator Nelson\u2019s recount fund to ensure every vote in Florida is counted accurately and fairly in this election:\nIf you\u2019ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation to Bill Nelson\u2019s Recount Fund will go through immediately:\nexpress donate: $10\nexpress donate: $25\nexpress donate: $50\nexpress donate: $100\nexpress donate: $250\nor, donate another amount\nEvery vote, at every site, in every state deserves to be counted. Every voice must be heard. That is what our democracy is all about.\nIf the Republicans won\u2019t join us in that ideal, then it\u2019s up to us to make it happen, which is why your donation to Bill\u2019s recount fund is so important.\nThanks and take care,\n\u2014 Kamala\n\u201cEvery moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.\u201d\n\u2013 Dolores Huerta\nPAID FOR BY KAMALA HARRIS FOR SENATE\nThis email was sent to Hall@mailinator.com.

            "msg_body": "10 years ago last week, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper. That 9 page paper and the accompanying code was our century\u2019s equivalent of Martin Luther\u2019s Ninety-five Theses that began the Protestant Reformation. However, the target of this reformation is not an organized religion but the existing financial system.It is fitting that Bitcoin was published in 2008, a time marking the most significant shortcomings of the financial status quo. Out of the depths of the great recession, Satoshi\u2019s invention emerged as the seed of a better financial future.That financial future gives people direct ownership of money through private keys rather than bank accounts, a money supply defined by software rather than government officials, and a way to transact without a trusted and potentially-censoring third-party. Innovations since Bitcoin, such as blockchain-based smart contracts, have further demonstrated the potential of these technologies to re-shape our financial system by changing the nature of how we transact, contract, and coordinate.The seed that Satoshi planted has sprouted and flourished in the last decade. Bitcoin has become a major currency and a plethora of other blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies have emerged.However, despite the significant advances, industry progress has been slower than many would have hoped for. We are still stuck with excessive centralization, fundamental performance problems, and have not yet hit true mass adoption.It is therefore up to all of us to finish what Satoshi started and fulfill crypto\u2019s potential.Gaps in potentialOur team takes pride in consistently doing what we say we\u2019ll do, so now I\u2019ll share the gaps in industry potential that we\u2019re aiming to close, starting with those that are blockchain-specific:Blockchains currently suffer from fundamental performance problems. For example, major blockchains such as Ethereum can only support roughly 30 transactions per second. We\u2019ve architected and implemented the Credo Blockchain to have an efficient Proof of Stake system with fast inter-miner communication using websocket and data streaming protocols along with a mechanism for counting votes as soon as a threshold is reached. We expect to considerably increase the TPS that our blockchain can support.Mining on major blockchains is overly centralized with a small number of major mining pools and companies. In some cases, the mining power is even sufficient to conduct a 51% attack, undermining the fundamental security that a blockchain offers. Our Proof of Stake system decentralizes mining by broadly distributing mining power among token holders. We are additionally working on a progressive dampening function to reduce the chance of excessive centralization by large stake holders.Mining currently has a very high barrier to entry since you need to purchase expensive and short-lived ASICs to participate. We are re-democratizing mining with the Credo Blockchain since you\u2019ll be able to profitably mine with just a laptop and a relatively small security deposit.Many cryptocurrencies still have inflationary properties due to new currency issuance in mining. Credo has a zero-issuance mining model in which miners are paid the accumulation of transaction fees in blocks.Due to the high cost of transaction on other blockchains, a substantial portion of transactions are driven off-chain. This off-the-books blockchain economy reduces transparency in transaction activity. With our higher throughput, we expect to perform all our transactions on-chain.Performing transactions on many chains is too expensive right now. It can cost in the several cents to over a dollar range on blockchains such as Ethereum. With lower mining costs via our PoS system, we expect to bring transaction costs down by an order of magnitude.Existing mining systems waste tremendous amounts of energy. Our blockchain will operate with a tiny fraction of the energy waste through its software rather than hardware focused consensus algorithm.Beyond those blockchain-specific gaps, the Credo Blockchain is one part of a comprehensive solution - with the BitBounce email paywall, BitBounce Ads advertising service, and CredoEx currency exchange - designed to more broadly fulfill crypto\u2019s potential.With this comprehensive solution, we are making crypto solve real world problems by eliminating email spam, having a tangible impact on everyday people through providing additional passive income from paid emails, and addressing some of humanity\u2019s most pressing needs by partially alleviating poverty via boosting the income of our users in the developing world; beyond income, we expect our solution to have broad-based wealth creating effects through the mass dissemination and appreciation of credos. This solution is already making a global impact by piggybacking on the existing email network, which is currently adopted by nearly 4 billion people. In doing so, we\u2019re also providing a way for dApps to gain far greater adoption by using BitBounce Ads as a distribution channel.We\u2019re doing this in a way that delivers real utility, beyond speculation, for consumers and businesses; consumers have the utility of defending themselves against spam while getting paid, and businesses can reach target customers in a way that can build greater brand loyalty than traditional advertising. This is all packaged in simple, beautiful, and easy-to-use interfaces.Currencies are valuable because people are willing to exchange them for other things of value, and we\u2019re making sure credos are actually exchangeable, initially by establishing and growing our currency pairs on CredoEx; we plan on eventually providing a path to acceptance of credo as tender for any legally purchasable good or service.With those effects, we\u2019ve established and are continuing to grow an actual token economy involving transactions between advertisers, paywall users, miners and traders; in this token economy, we\u2019re now seeing token economic principles come to bear rather than just chaotic fluctuations from the shifting sentiments of market speculators.Since holding our first token sale, our team has massively over-delivered on the promises we made in the original whitepaper. We\u2019ve continued to update our whitepaper as our solution has evolved from additional customer input and innovations. We are about to publish our 5th version, and aim to be a model for improved financing of technology development via ICOs using a multi-offering, execute-raise-execute-raise process.To sum it up, we believe that crypto has the potential to dramatically improve the world and eat traditional finance, and our goal is to bring that complete potential to fruition via our comprehensive and evolving solution.Blockchain detailsNow that I\u2019ve informed you about the gaps in potential that we\u2019re filling, let me share more about the specific blockchain we\u2019ve developed:The Credo Blockchain is built on an efficient p2p communication layer with a websocket and data streaming transport protocol. This means that a socket is maintained between peer nodes and block bodies are streamed in chunks rather than sent all at once.On top of this, we have a various mechanisms for managing miners participating in the Proof of Stake consensus process. Any node in the network can become a miner through issuing a security deposit of credos that will be held for a minimum period of time. Once the security deposit is validated and a given number of blocks have passed, that node can begin voting on new blocks and proposing blocks when it is selected to do so. If a mining node goes offline, other mining nodes will quickly discontinue including it in the set of miners that could be chosen to propose a block through decreasing its participation rate; that participation rate will quickly recover when the node comes back online and start voting again. If a mining nodes changes to a new IP address, it can submit an ip update transaction signed by the private key associated with its security deposit address in order to prove to and inform the other miners that it should be communicated with at the new IP address. If a withdrawal is attempted before the security deposits timelock has expired, the transaction is not processed. Miners can also be removed if they are penalized for voting on multiple blocks at the same time, which can happen through another miner submitting a transaction containing a proof that the miner signed votes for multiple blocks for a given block number and voting round. These mechanisms allow for the addition and removal of miners, as well as updating their state so that they can be communicated with and included appropriately.We then have another set of mechanisms for proposing and voting on blocks. In order to determine the next block in the blockchain, one miner who has contributed a security deposit is selected pseudo-randomly to propose the next block. This selection is deposit-weighted so that miners with a higher stake will get to propose more blocks, participation-rate-weighted to avoid calling on offline nodes, and deterministic so that all nodes will reach the same conclusion about which miner should propose the next block. If a miner does not propose a block before a specified timeout, another miner will be selected to propose it through updating the pseudo-random selection to be seeded by a retry count. When a miner successfully proposes a block, it is compensated with the sum of transaction fees for all transactions in the proposed block through a special transaction.Once other nodes receive the pending block, they cast and broadcast votes to other miners. When a sufficient number of votes has been received, miners count the votes and check whether a block has received a supermajority of votes weighted by stake size. If a block has a supermajority of votes, miners will broadcast it to all nodes as the confirmed block; if no block has a supermajority of votes, miners will vote again. These mechanisms allow for blocks to be proposed and voted on to achieve network consensus on the valid chain.Our blockchain will also support a finality threshold after which a node will not accept a new block that has a chain excluding blocks before the finality threshold. New nodes will also receive a hash of the valid chain from seed nodes when bootstrapping to ensure they sync with the correct chain.This is our blockchain for the first phase of development and testnet launch. Future phases will add third-party token support, Turing Complete smart contract functionality, sharding, and other innovations.If you\u2019d like to learn more about the implementation, we\u2019ll open source the project between now and the mainnet launch. Once the source code is available, I hope some of you will become contributors.Ecosystem rolesThat brings me to how you can participate in the ecosystem we\u2019re forming.There are several roles you can adopt, including:\nCredo miners run our Credo Core node software, produce and vote on new blocks, and mine Credo in the process. To become a miner, you\u2019ll need to download and run our node software and buy enough Credo to make a security deposit.\nCredo developers build applications and tokens on top of the blockchain, or contribute to the core node project. To become a developer, you just need to access the repo for our source code and start contributing. We\u2019ve written a wiki and will publish additional articles to make it easier to start developing.\nEmail paywall users trade their attention for credos via BitBounce. You can do this just by signing up for BitBounce and adding one of your email accounts.\nAdvertisers run marketing campaigns to paywall users. You can get started with sending campaigns by signing up for BitBounce Ads. You can pay with a credit or debit card via BitBounce Ads, in which case your payments will be converted to credo via market buy orders on CredoEx.\nTraders buy and sell credo on our exchange and others. To trade, just open an account on CredoEx and deposit some funds to begin trading.\nCredo OfferingAll that brings me to the final major announcement I\u2019ll make this evening. We have accomplished a tremendous amount with the proceeds of our first token sale. We\u2019ve grown our team from just me and my wife to a world-class team of 14 with truly outstanding industry leaders on our board of advisors such as Tim Draper and Patrick Chung, massively grown our adoption for BitBounce and completely revamped the product, created our own exchange with CredoEx, invented and developed BitBounce Ads so that users would be paid more, and now we\u2019ve made our own blockchain.That said, as I\u2019ve touched on already, we have much larger plans for the crypto industry. In order to most effectively execute on these plans, a larger team and more resources will be required. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to hold a second offering for credo using the company\u2019s reserve tokens. We\u2019ll hold this offering in Q1 of 2019 and our target is to raise $100 million dollars.The second main reason for doing this sale is to substantially broaden the set of miners participating in our Proof of Stake system. Given that goal, we\u2019ll be looking to get as many individual buyers as possible to participate in the offering.In the run up to this sale, we\u2019ll publish a new whitepaper, deck, various articles, and make additional material disclosures including the Credo Blockchain\u2019s source code. While many token sales were conducted with merely a white paper, I believe our second offering will be for one of the most mature and advanced projects that the market has seen yet. I\u2019m excited to conduct a successful offering, continue to execute on our mission and vision, and also set an example that other projects can follow.--I want each and every one of you to become a part of the new Credo economy and ecosystem we are forming.

In 1897, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania to continue teaching history, and by 1908 had become a full professor. From 1907 to 1928, he served as dean of Pennsylvania's graduate school. As dean, Ames made his office in room 105 of College Hall, a room which he shared with the rest of the graduate school staff. Under his administration, the number of graduate students at Pennsylvania increased five-fold and, in 1923, he consulted with U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes on implementing a scholarship to fund the study of diplomacy at Pennsylvania using an $80,000 endowment from the late Frederic Courtland Penfield, which was among the largest university scholarship funds in existence at that time. At Pennsylvania, Ames established a reputation for \"tact, firmness and high ideals of scholarship\". John Musser, one of his former students and graduate assistants, recalled that Ames' relationship with his students was accessible, courteous, and helpful and that he was known for welcoming students to his home and keeping notes on their careers after they had graduated. University provost Josiah Penniman would echo Musser's assessment, stating that he knew \"of no dean who was more deeply interested in the graduate students of the University, not only those who were studying American History, but all who were studying in any courses\". chart showing the academic genealogy of Herman Ames A pedigree chart showing the academic genealogy of Herman Ames headshot of Ezra Pound Ezra Pound, pictured here in 1913, took courses from Ames in 1901.

            "msg_body": "Dear Friend,\n\t\t\tI'm not going to pull any punches. You're going to be angry and shocked by what I'm about to share with you.\n\t\t\tWhen you stick to a program by the letter and do everything your trainer tells you, you expect results, right?\n\t\t\tWell, what if you discovered all your hard work was causing you to be MORE prone to injury, was having ZERO effect on the shape of your butt and was leaving you with LESS strength and power?\n\t\t\tWhat if you discovered you were ALWAYS going to fall short of the body you want, because...\n\t\t\tYou've been LIED TO about how to train your body's BIGGEST muscle...\n\t\t\tAnd it's cost you in your performance, your health and even how you look.\nI'm talking about your glutes.\n\t\t\tYour glutes are your body's most powerful muscle, yet they're also the most misunderstood.\nWhen you discover the right way to unlock your glutes, everything changes. You can put the pedal to the metal on your gains.\n\t\t\tAnd you know when you've trained your glutes the right way, as you're the proud owner of a strong, round, healthy butt.\n\t\t\tAll The Best\n\t\t\tAlex\nHerman Vandenburg Ames (August 7, 1865 \u2013 February 7, 1935) was an American legal historian, educator, and documentary preservationist long associated with the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of United States constitutional history and, from 1907 to 1928, dean of its graduate school. His 1897 monograph, The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History, was a landmark work in American constitutional history. Other works by Ames included John C. Calhoun and the Secession Movement of 1850, Slavery and the Union 1845\u20131861, and The X.Y.Z. Letters, the latter of which he authored with John Bach McMaster. Among his notable students were Ezra Pound, John Musser, and Herbert Eugene Bolton. A member of the Ames family, Herman Ames was born in Massachusetts and educated at Amherst College. He received his doctorate from Harvard University, where he was the Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fellow in Constitutional and International Law, and studied under Albert Bushnell Hart. Like Hart, Ames spent time in Europe learning German historical methodology and was influenced in his own research by its approach. He was a driving force behind the establishment of the Pennsylvania State Archives and helped guide the widespread establishment of government archives throughout the United States. His papers are housed at the University of Pennsylvania's University Archives. Herman Ames was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1865 to Marcus Ames and Jane Angeline Ames (n\u00e9e Vandenburg). Ames' father, Marcus, was educated at Philips Andover Academy, where he graduated as valedictorian before studying medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was ordained in 1854, becoming in the words of David Ford a \"brilliant, fervent, and impressive\" Congregational preacher who ministered throughout Massachusetts, later serving as superintendent of the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls and chaplain of Rhode Island's asylum, prison, workhouse, and almshouse. Marcus Ames' parents\u2014Herman Ames' paternal grandparents\u2014were Azel Ames and Mercy Ames (n\u00e9e Hatch). Herman Ames' great grandfather, Job Ames, served in the Massachusetts Militia during the American Revolution. The Ames family descended from William Ames, who immigrated to the Province of Massachusetts Bay from the town of Bruton, England, in 1641. The family's surname may have been a corruption of the name Amyas (meaning \"merchant of Amiens\"). In the 16th century Amyas was frequently confused with Ames. Education Ames was educated at the Mowry and Goff School in Providence, Rhode Island. After graduating, he enrolled at Brown University before transferring to Amherst College, where he was initiated into the Delta Upsilon fraternity and later became the chapter president. During the Delta Upsilon convention of 1887, Ames played a central role in resolving an intra-fraternity dispute concerning the authority by which the Executive Council of Delta Upsilon had admitted the DePauw University chapter some months earlier. As a student at Amherst, he was particularly influenced by Anson D. Morse, whom he credited with cultivating in him \"a judicial attitude in the study of history\", years later recalling that he had \"never come in contact with a teacher who was so judicially minded\". Photograph of the Delta Upsilon chapter house at Amherst College in 1890 Herman Ames was initiated into Delta Upsilon at Amherst College, whose chapter house is shown here at about the time he was its president. Ames graduated from Amherst with an A.B. degree in 1888, and thereafter entered Harvard University. At Harvard he received an A.M. in 1890 and a Ph.D. the following year for his dissertation The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which was done under the supervision of Albert Bushnell Hart. During his time at Harvard, he was the Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fellow in Constitutional and International Law. Between 1891 and 1894, Ames lectured in history at the University of Michigan under an appointment as acting assistant professor to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of J.H.T. McPherson. Though his interest was in U.S. history, at Michigan Ames was charged with teaching courses covering a variety of periods of world history, an assignment to which he would admit he was \"not particularly prepared\", but he resigned himself to the idea that \"one must make a beginning somewhere, and this was the opening offered\". He later recalled this first teaching experience \"was a valuable one to me, far more so, I fear, than to the students taught. I was afforded the opportunity to become acquainted with the life and work of the leading state university of the time\". \n",

[There's a REAL scientific proof behind it.]\nAnd no I'm not talking about the usual law of attraction B.S or other Pseudo-Science thingamajigs.\nBecause when you compare those to what I'm about to share with you...\nThere's a noticeably HUGE gap between simply 'wishing' something to happen versus to what these people are doing.\nAnd as ridiculous as this all sounds...\nI found myself nodding in agreement right around the 2 minute mark.\n[Click HERE to find out why.]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_____________________________________________________________________\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_____________________________________________________________________\nDuring the 1901\u201302 academic year, Ames was one of Ezra Pound's instructors at Pennsylvania; Pound scholar David Ten Eyck credits him with stimulating the poet's interest in American history. Pound would later recall that Ames' \"courses had a vitality outlasting the mere time of his lectures\" and would humorously note that Ames was \"undisturbed and undistracted\" by students playing ping pong outside his office. According to Ten Eyck, studies of Pound's notes from Ames' courses indicate his \"deep interest in the subject\nthat must have provided a foundation for  later reflections on American history\". After Ames' death, Pound would note that\u2014though they had no more contact than \"perhaps two or three letters\" in the ensuing decades\u2014he continued to harbor a \"strong, personal affection\" towards Ames, citing this as proof of \"humanity overcoming all systems of invented partition\". Another notable student of Ames included Herbert Eugene Bolton.\nAs a scholar of legal history, his view of the United States Constitution was at once both liberal in its outlook while also guarded at attempts to meddle with its basic framework. When the eighteenth amendment, introducing prohibition of alcohol, was enacted he immediately and correctly predicted its eventual repeal.\nIn his view on history, Ames was both presentist and relativist; during a public lecture given at Muhlenberg College in 1909 he characterized the daily customs and behavior of early American settlers as \"barbarous\" compared to contemporary standards, and credited the growth of democracy with the development of more liberal social norms. At the same time, however, he cautioned about passing moral judgments on leaders of the past based on modern expectations. As an instructor of history, Ames was described by contemporary\nhistorian Wayne Journell as \"unabashedly\" supportive of its use to invigorate support for the government's policies during World War I, quoting him that \"it is the duty of the teacher of history and civics to seize the wonderful opportunity afforded by the war to aid in promoting an intelligent and patriotic public opinion in support of the government in these critical times\". Musser offered contradictory recollections of Ames' academic approach, describing him as having a completely objective and impartial view towards both history and current affairs and viewing with skepticism the idea that concerns such as politics or national interest should influence his teaching or research.\n",

He also held visiting lectureships at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley. Active in scholarly exchanges, Ames served on the Administrative Board of the Institute of International Education, led the Council of National Defense Philadelphia host committee during the 1920 visit of a British educational mission to the city, and represented the University of Pennsylvania to the 1909 convention of the American Association of Universities. He was the commencement speaker during the 1923 graduation exercises at New Brunswick High School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, delivering an address titled \"Preparing for Citizenship\". During the 1925 University of Pennsylvania commencement exercises, Ames and John Carew Rolfe both received honorary Doctor of Letters degrees. After 21 years as head of Pennsylvania's graduate school, Ames resigned his post in 1928 and was succeeded by the classicist H. Lamar Crosby. He continued his teaching duties until his death. Writing and research Ames' administrative and teaching duties were an ongoing encumbrance on his research activity, limiting him to a small, albeit influential, body of work. The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States Ames' 1897 monograph The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History, which indexed 1,736 amendments proposed to the United States Constitution, was an expansion of his doctoral dissertation. According to Ames, he had returned from his travels in Europe too late in the year to find a teaching assignment and decided to spend the ensuing months writing and researching instead. Ames' 400-page opus marked the first exhaustive catalog of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution ever compiled. Ames personally visited a large number of state and federal offices to record the details of the thousands of amending resolutions that had been proposed during the preceding hundred years. In discussing his research, Ames concluded that many of the amendments had failed as they were \"cures for .\n",

            "msg_body": "End Gutter Cleaning for life\nHeating or electricity is one of the most considerable costs in the operation of greenhouses across the globe, especially in colder climates. The main problem with heating a greenhouse as opposed to a building that has solid opaque walls is the amount of heat lost through the greenhouse covering. Since the coverings need to allow light to filter into the structure, they conversely cannot insulate very well. With traditional plastic greenhouse coverings having an R-value of around 2, a great amount of money is therefore spent to continually replace the heat lost. Most greenhouses, when supplemental heat is needed use natural gas or electric furnaces.  Passive heating methods exist which seek heat using low energy input. Solar energy can be captured from periods of relative abundance (day time/summer), and released to boost the temperature during cooler periods (night time/winter). Waste heat from livestock can also be used to heat greenhouses, e.g., placing a chicken coop inside a greenhouse recovers the heat generated by the chickens, which would otherwise be wasted.[citation needed] Some greenhouses also rely on geothermal heating. Cooling is typically done by opening windows in the greenhouse when it gets too warm for the plants inside it. This can be done manually, or in an automated manner. Window actuators can open windows due to temperature difference or can be opened by electronic controllers. Electronic controllers are often used to monitor the temperature and adjusts the furnace operation to the conditions. This can be as simple as a basic thermostat, but can be more complicated in larger greenhouse operations. \n",

            "msg_body": "The Battle of Greece (also known as Operation Marita, German: Unternehmen Marita) is the common name for the invasion of Allied Greece by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in April 1941 during World War II. The Italian invasion in October 1940, which is usually known as the Greco-Italian War, was followed by the German invasion in April 1941. German landings on the island of Crete (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece. These battles were part of the greater Balkan Campaign of Germany. \nI am SUPER excited...

Because it actually transforms your body to burn fat all the time, even when you're sitting around doing nothing!\n\t\t\tIn fact, some folks are losing up to 23lbs of fat in just 21 days by drinking it every morning.\n\t\t\tPlus, it's super easy to make right in your own kitchen.\n\t\t\tIf you haven't tried this yet, you're going to want to add this to your morning routine (Especially after today's!)\n\t\t\tTalk soon and have fun today!\n1 Cup of this tomorrow morning will burn 3lbs of belly fat\nFollowing the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940, Greece repulsed the initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, the bulk of the Greek Army was on the Greek border with Albania, then a protectorate of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. German troops invaded from Bulgaria, creating a second front. Greece had already received a small, inadequate reinforcement from British, Australian and New Zealand forces in anticipation of the German\ntemporary evils ... were trivial or impracticable ...  found a place in that unwritten constitution that has grown up side by side with the written document\". He also opined that the majorities required for ratification of amendments were so large as to create \"insurmountable constitutional obstacles\" to amendment, a frequent criticism leveled during the Progressive Era.\nA review of the volume in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science concluded it was \"a laborious and painstaking piece of work\". The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History earned Ames the American Historical Association's Justin Winsor Prize. It was reprinted in 1970. Other works\nOther works by Ames included John C. Calhoun and the Secession Movement of 1850, Slavery and the Union 1845\u20131861, and The X.Y.Z. Letters, the latter of which he authored with John Bach McMaster. Ames also edited a volume of State Documents on Federal Relations, a multi-issue compendium of state legislative documents pertaining to the U.S. government. Archival preservation\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the American Historical Association (AHA) undertook a nationwide effort to examine repositories of manuscripts and archival documents, and make specific recommendations for their future preservation. The initiative was partly influenced by Ames' advocacy of German historical methodology, learned during his year in Europe, which placed special emphasis on primary documentary sources. At the behest of the AHA, Ames spent several weeks in Harrisburg, in 1899, examining Pennsylvania's state records, which were poorly organized and largely scattered across various state\noffices. He co-authored, with historian Lewis Slifer Shimmel, a report on their status and, in 1900, filed a separate report on the state of the Philadelphia municipal archives. Their report concluded that over the years Pennsylvania's public records had been partially plundered by government officials with some state documents known to be held by libraries in New York and Boston, and others probably once bearing the original signature of William Penn had since had their signature lines cut out, perhaps for souvenir keeping. Ames continued his attempts to inventory Pennsylvania public records in tandem with his teaching duties at the University of Pennsylvania, although his efforts were hampered by the tradition that all state government offices closed promptly at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. \n",
