If you didn\u2019t get a chance to attend, or watch the replay, this is your chance to get some high value training. Save your spot in the training here.\nThe coolest thing happened... I tried this crazy challenge where I attempted \u2014 almost like a magician \u2014 to get the attendees a paying client on the spot DURING the live training...\nWell, guess what? It worked.\nA whole bunch of people in the live chat were saying how the challenge got them leads and interest in their business \u2014 even paying clients! It\u2019s as if the only thing holding them back from launching their business, and getting started was\u2026 well, a push (and I push pretty hard).\nCheck out what Jason (who immediately joined the Masterclass) said...\n\"Just got a PM on Facebook for a potential job already just from the webinar challenge. Meeting [tomorrow] to discuss details. Holy s***!!! I'm speechless bro!\"\nIf I can get attendees their first client with a FREE webinar...\nJust imagine the magic I can perform for you when you join Freelancing Freedom Masterclass!\nListen, I get that joining something like this can be scary\u2026\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work for ME?\u201d You might be thinking.\nWhen you join Freelancing Freedom Masterclass, I personally guarantee you will book at least 1 paying client within 180 days of joining.\nIf you do the work and make an honest effort, and it doesn\u2019t result in booking a client\u2026 you can have your money back.

If after all of that, you don\u2019t have your first paying client within the first 180 days, you can have your money back AND keep the course.\nWhy do you have to do the work? Well, did you think that just by joining a course, you\u2019d magically book a client? I mean... I know I was like a magician in my webinar, but if you don't show up and do your part \u2014 I can't do anything for you!

But he wasn\u2019t the only heroic\n    police officer on the scene, just the only one who was able to\n    engage.\u00a0\nAt the link is the story of at least six other unarmed,\n    off-duty officers who just happened to be inside when the shots\n    began, and how they shielded civilians with their own bodies to\n    protect them.\nWhen you hear\u00a0leftist\u00a0protesters attacking the\n    police, remember these brave officers and how they literally\n    illustrated the way police put their lives on the line every\n    day by placing themselves between the innocent and those who\n    would prey on them. They don\u2019t even ask what the people\n    they\u2019re protecting think about the police. They just\n    \u201cprotect and serve.\u201d\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/sheriff-reveals-heroic-actions-6-off-duty-officers-bar-massacre/\n---------------------------\nRanting and raving\nBy Mike Huckabee\nI already shared a couple of these, but here\u2019s an\n        even larger round-up of top Democrats who are now ranting,\n        stirring up protests, and threatening investigations and\n        impeachment over Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced\n        resignation\u00a0and\u00a0who just a year or so ago were\n        demanding Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced resignation.\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/ct/democrats-demand-sessions-resignation/\nThey claim this is because Trump is trying to obstruct\n        and kill the Mueller investigation, which he\u2019s never\n        obstructed since the very\u00a0beginning\u00a0 when they\n        told us that firing James Comey (another guy Democrats had\n        demanded be fired) was an attempt\n        to\u00a0obstruct\u00a0justice \u2013 even thought the\n        investigation has done nothing since but expand, spend\n        millions of taxpayer dollars, and as far as we know, find\n        zero collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and\n        Russia.\nYou know, I\u2019m beginning to think it doesn\u2019t\n        really matter what Trump does, Democrats are going to\n        scream and protest and launch investigations and claim\n        it\u2019s the \u201cEND OF THE WORLD\u201d because\n        they\u2019re as addicted to it as some people are to video\n        games. I just wish if they can\u2019t stop playing this\n        pointless, time-wasting game, they\u2019d use their own\n        quarters to feed their addiction and quit spending\n        mine.\n------------------------------\nBenton Blount\nBy Mike Huckabee\nVery disappointed to hear that a renegade non-conformist\n    like guitarist Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top seems to endorse trying\n    to kill other musicians\u2019 careers for daring to express a\n    non-leftist snowflake-approved opinion. Let\u2019s hope he\n    steps up for free speech and against censorship of\n    conservatives, which is both bad and nationwide, and reverses\n    this injustice.\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d like to introduce you to a new\n    musical talent who really is a renegade and a non-conformist.\n    His name is Benton Blount. I think you\u2019re going to like\n    him.\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/political-post-by-americas-got-talent-alum-gets-him-kicked-off-tour\n-------------\n-----------------------\nThe Baltic Experience 2019\nBy Mike Huckabee\nI am thrilled to announce an unforgettable trip to the\n      Baltics for the summer of 2019!\u00a0After many years of the\n      Israel Experiences and our most recent trip the Mediterranean\n      Experience cruise, we are bringing you another phenomenal\n      cruise, the Baltic Experience! This all-inclusive cruise will\n      feature some of the most beautiful places in the Baltic Sea\n      and we will get to travel to and absorb these destinations\n      aboard a luxury cruise ship from the Azamara Cruise line. If\n      you have traveled with us before, you already know that\n      all-inclusive means exactly that and there are no surprises\n      along the way. The Baltic Experience will be no different.\n      And when the weather is often unbearably hot throughout most\n      of the US in August, we will be enjoying the cool and\n      delightful weather that makes travel in the Baltic region\n      perfect.\u00a0Once again we have the entire ship and will\n      fill our time on board with spectacular entertainment and\n      special guests. In addition to the cruise we have multiple\n      pre and post cruise offerings you can choose from to extend\n      your trip. Our last cruise sold out in record time so we\n      encourage you to get your cabin secured soon. We look forward\n      to traveling with you soon and as always we will work\n      tirelessly and do everything in our control to bring you The\n      Greatest Trip.\nTo\n      learn more about this exciting trip, visit my website\n      here.\nSee you on the boat,\nMike Huckabee\n-----------------------------\nLegally younger\nBy Mike Huckabee\nEmile Ratelband is a 69-year-old retiree in the Netherlands.\n    But in this mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world where girls\n    can be boys and boys can be girls, why can\u2019t Emile be\n    49?\u00a0\nSince people can now legally change their birth certificate\n    to whatever gender they identify as, he\u2019s suing to change\n    his to the age he identifies as. Emile claims he feels and\n    looks 20 years younger than he is, and he\u2019s suffering age\n    discrimination. He thinks he\u2019d score more jobs and dates\n    on Tinder if he were the \u201cTinder age\u201d of 49. Locals\n    are debating whether he\u2019s mentally disturbed or extremely\n    \u201cwoke.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily an\n    \u201ceither/or\u201d situation. The judge admits he has a\n    point legally, but he says if the government moves\n    Emile\u2019s birth date forward, they\u2019d have to delete\n    all the records from the first 20 years of his life, and who\n    would he have been then?\nHold on a minute. As long as we\u2019ve decided we can\n    repeal reality, who says it has to be the first 20 years? Why\n    can\u2019t we erase the year when we had to go through potty\n    training, or the year we had our worst job, or broke our leg or\n    had to take Algebra class? We should all be allowed to pick the\n    20 worst years we ever had to live through and erase those.\nSure, that would leave us all living in a state of denial,\n    having learned nothing about how to deal with real problems.\n    But as long as we\u2019re heading that way anyway, we might as\n    well be 20 years younger.\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/world/dutch-businessman-69-seeks-to-legally-identify-as-20-years-younger\n------------------------------\nThey must have missed school\nBy Mike Huckabee\nOne of the many dangers of not teaching young people civics\n    and real American history (aside from the newly-elected House)\n    is that they grow up not understanding even the simplest\n    concepts about the Constitution and why our system of\n    government is so brilliant and works so well.\u00a0 It\u2019s\n    filled with multiple layers of checks and balances to insure\n    that one faction can never seize permanent, unchallengable\n    power over the others.\u00a0 One way is with the divided\n    branches of government.\u00a0 Another is the way that the power\n    of population numbers represented by House districts is\n    balanced with equal representation of each state in the\n    Senate.\u00a0 That way, the House may reflect the passions of\n    the majority, but its rash actions and passing fancies are\n    tempered by the more deliberate and broad-based power of the\n    Senate, representing the interests of all the states\n    equally.\nSeriously, that\u2019s about all you need to know to have a\n    basic grasp of the difference between the House and the\n    Senate.\u00a0 So why in the world are so many\n    \u201cprogressives\u201d latching on to the obvious fact that\n    some states have more residents than others but all get only\n    two Senators and waving it around like a bloody flag as some\n    sort of affront to democracy?\u00a0 No, it really doesn\u2019t\n    matter if California contains more of the \u201cpopular\n    vote\u201d than Alaska; that doesn\u2019t mean they should\n    get more Senators, nor that we should abolish the Senate and\n    have pure mob rule. In railing about this\n    \u201cinjustice\u201d on Twitter, Amanda Marcotte, who passes\n    as a political analyst at Salon.com, lamented darkly,\n    \u201cOur country is not a democracy.\u201d No.\u00a0 No, it\n    isn\u2019t, and was never meant to be. Were you out sick that\n    day in junior high?\nIt\u2019s no wonder Hillary Clinton was their idol: they\n    all have a basic misunderstanding of what the \u201cpopular\n    vote\u201d means (in both the Electoral College and Senate\n    races, it means n-o-t-h-i-n-g, and deliberately so.)\nStill, as dumb as this whole new argument is, I have to say,\n    \u201cBless your heart\u201d to Joy Behar of \u201cThe\n    View.\u201d\u00a0 This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard\n    anyone blame the fact that densely-populated blue states have\n    the same number of Senators as less populous red states on\n    \u201cgerrymandering.\u201d\u00a0 The populations of those\n    blue states must be getting really dense.\nhttps://freebeacon.com/politics/behar-blames-gerrymandering-midterms-dowd-explains-constitution/\n-----------------------------\nEvening Edition - November 8\nBy Mike Huckabee\nA wrap-up of all the news you might have missed\n    yesterday!\nREAD\n      MORE\nDaily Verse\n\"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of\n    plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of\n    apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that\n    which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet\n    spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\"\n-\u00a01 Peter 3:3-4\nDid you miss reading a newsletter recently?\u00a0 \n      Go to our\n      archive here.\nThis e-mail was sent to mike@mailinator.com\nClick here\n    to unsubscribe\nBlue Diamond Media\n     Blue Diamond Media\nP.O.

In 3 years, TripActions has attracted more than 1k corporate customers, growing 700% this past year.\nInvestors are also keen on the scene. TripActions has raised $231.5m so far, and as a part of this most recent round of funding Ben Horowitz (yes, that Horowitz) has joined the company\u2019s board.\nTripActions plans to use its funding to make its systems even smarter, investing heavily in R&D and machine-learning improvements.\n[Disclaimer: TripActions is an advertiser with The Hustle. Our advertising and editorial teams operate independently and this does not impact our coverage.]\n\u00bb\nA better way to waste company cash\nNetflix\u2019s hackathon only seems like a bad idea\nYesterday, Netflix publicized two of the \u2018features\u2019 that came out of its biannual hackathon: facial-recognition that lets users control the app with their tongues and a \u2018jump to shark\u2019 button that lets viewers skip parts of movies that don\u2019t include sharks.\nThese two features are absurd. But, hackathons are increasingly popular across all different types of companies. What\u2019s even more absurd? They actually work.\nA quick hack-story lesson\nHackathons are concentrated design workshops that challenge participants to create a working product in one sitting.\u00a0\nThe events became popular in the first dot-com boom as a way for global programmers to gather in one room to build a product in one work session, thereby avoiding the legal challenges of sharing IP across borders.\nBut, hackathons have since evolved into a cultural phenomenon: Hack-style development is central to Facebook\u2019s culture (the company\u2019s address is 1 Hacker Way), and organizations like TechCrunch host annual hackathons with prizes as high as $250k.\nThe benefits of staying hack-tive\u00a0\nA surprising number of hackathons have resulted in success: Startup GroupMe spun out of a TechCrunch hackathon and was sold for $85m a year later.\u00a0\nInternal hackathons have also panned out: Many of Facebook\u2019s most popular features (Facebook Chat and the \u2018Like\u2019 button we see across the internet) started out as hackathon ideas.\nAccording to management consultants, hackathons are a great business practice for any kind of company because they inspire outside-the-box creativity and allow for quick, low-cost prototyping.\u00a0\n\u00bb\nWho invented the Poke feature, though?\nVice Media tightens its belt, plans to cut staff by 15%\u00a0\nThe alt-media titan\u2019s new CEO, Nancy Dubuc (who replaced Shane Smith in March) ordered a companywide hiring freeze 6 weeks ago -- now, The Wall Street Journal reports that she plans to trim staff by 10-15%.\nWhere has the audience gone?\nVice Media had 27m unique visitors in September, down from 49.1m in March of 2016, and is reportedly expected to make between $600m and $650m this year, on track to lose more than $50m (it also lost $100m in 2017).\u00a0\nAt a board meeting on Tuesday, Dubuc suggested the company focus on areas of growth, like making more television shows and movies for third parties.\nDubuc also plans to consolidate to 3-5 verticals (it currently runs more than a dozen, including Munchies, Noisey, and Broadly).\nNow Disney is covering its a**\nDisney, who originally invested a reported $400m in Vice back in 2015, is taking a $157m write-down on its stake after the announcement.\nThe turmoil comes amid a broader drought in digital media, as media rivals like Vox Media and Refinery29 (which announced last month it would lay off about 10% of its workforce) missed revenue targets in recent months as well.\n\u00bb\nYou could always fire Action Bronson\nSPONSORED\nThis company is infusing denim with a healthy dose of performance\nAnd they\u2019re doing it in style -- because to look good, you gotta feel good.\u00a0\nAfter years spent designing world-class athletic apparel, the founding team at Revtown had one of those solid-gold ideas you hear so much about.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if we apply the comfort, function, and durability of performance apparel to denim?\u201d\nThe result? Crazy comfort and solid style at a killer price\nIt\u2019s called Decade Denim, and it\u2019s the solution to an age-old question: Should you dress for style or comfort?\u00a0\nThis Italian-milled denim is tough as nails, but mobile when you need it to be with the timeless style we crave. They\u2019re the kind of pants that whisper in your ear \u201cmake no compromise, you lean mean jean machine\u201d, because that\u2019s what Revtown does.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t believe us? We took our Decade Denim for a spin around the block, and here\u2019s just a few of the things we discovered you can do: Sit, squat, sprint, split, sail, shovel, salsa, and even dodge a fleet of e-scooters to get to your bus before it pulls away.\u00a0\nPoint being, these bad boys can do it all.

            "msg_body": "Kre-Alkalyn FAQ\nBenefits Of Creatine, Without The Side-Effects!\nFor more info go to Kre-Alkalyn Pumped Extreme\n1. What is it and where does it come from?\nKre-Alkalyn is \"buffered creatine\" that does not convert \ninto creatinine prior to reaching skeletal muscle tissue. \nKre-Alkalyn is a nutritional supplement that comes in \npowder form. It is packaged in a caplet that can be \nadministered orally.\nKre-Alkalyn is manufactured by All American Pharmaceutical \nCorporation and is registered under United States patent \n6,399,661.\n2. What does it do?\nKre-Alkalyn is believed to have the benefits of regular \ncreatine, without the associated side-effects of creatine \nmonohydrate use. The efficacy and safety of creatine monohydrate \nis well established in scientific literature and thus \nKre-Alaklyn is believed to have the same ergogenic abilities \nand safety profile.\nManufacturer product information states that Kre-Alkalyn is \nprocessed at a higher PH level than regular creatine monohydrate. \nIt is believed that the conversion of creatine to creatinine is\na function of PH level and that conversion of creatine into \nthe waste product creatinine can be halted by PH level \nmanipulation during the manufacture process.\nSlowing or stopping the conversion of creatine to creatinine \nmay help the body absorb more creatine, thus lowering the \ndosages required for beneficial results. This can result in \nan economic savings for the consumer as less creatine will \nbe required for the same results.\nAnecdotal evidence for Kre-Alkalyn has been mostly positive. \nMany users report a decrease in water retention and the \nelimination of the infamous \"creatine bloat.\" Many users \nalso report immediate results and the elimination of the \n\"loading\" phase normally required for regular creatine \nmonohydrate use.\n3. Who needs it and are there any signs of deficiency?\nEveryone can benefit from Kre-Alkalyn supplementation.\nAthletes can benefit from enhanced immune system function \nand increased muscle mass and functional strength that may \nbe seen from creatine use.\nSeniors may benefit from creatine use because creatine \ncan help to maintain muscle tissue. Muscle tissue \nprotects bone mass from stress and fracture, and creatine \nmay thus help protect muscle tissue, thereby indirectly \nprotecting bone mass.\nThere are no signs of deficiency.\n4. Are there any studies that proves Kre-Alkalyn works better \nthen creatine monohydrate?\nYes, there are:\nDecember 9, 2006\nClinical Trial Comparison of Kre-Alkalyn -vs- Creatine\nMonohydrate\nBy: Dr. Afgerinos Affouras (sports doctor, CSKA senior \nsoccer team), Dr. Katia Vodenicharova, M.D. (therapist, nephr\nologist), Dr. Dobriana Shishmanova (PhD cardilogist), Dr. \nKrassimir Goranov M.D., Dr. Karmen Stroychev M.D. \nTest Performed at: Dr. I.S. Greenberg Medical Center, Sofia, Bulgaria\nPurpose of Study: To determine if a difference exists between Kre-Alkalyn and\nCreatine Monohydrate.\nProcedures: 24 healthy male Olympic-level soccer players were divided\nrandomly into two groups.  One group ingested Kre-Alkalyn and\nthe other used Creatine Monohydrate.  This was a 4 month study.\nConclusion & Final Analysis: Kre-Alkalyn out performed creatine monohydrate in n\nearly all ergonometry measurements. Most notable were that Kre-Alkalyn \nactually lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels over creatine.  \npH was also found to be elevated in the Kre-Alkalyn group. The most \nsignificant performance finding was an increase in VO2 Max of the Kre-Alkalyn\ngroup over the creatine group.\n5. How much should be taken? Are there any side effects?\nStrictly adhere to label directions.\nNo side-effects have been noted from studies and anecdotal evidence. \nIntroducing The World's Only 100% Absorption Creatine for \nMaximum Results!

            "msg_body": "Weekly highlights from our family and faith content.\nNovember 9, 2018\nHow God Redeemed Mac and Mary Owen's Marriage\nIn 1976 Mac Owen and Mary Howard were high school sweethearts from Louisiana who experienced heartache after realizing they were expecting a child during their respective junior and senior years. Convinced Mac couldn't support a family, Mary moved out of her hometown the summer after graduating high school to give birth to a baby boy she wouldn't be allowed to see.\n Mary once believed making an adoption plan when she was 16 years old would be the hardest moment of her life. Yet 14 years later, she and Mac encountered a trial dark enough to destroy their family.\n  In 1988 Mary knew something terrible was happening to her husband. \nDivided on Adoption  \nFrom an early age, I knew that adoption would be a part of my life. I took a semester off  to work in an orphanage in Jamaica, where I taught preschool and saw babies left at the front gate by parents who had long since run out of resources.\n I met Mike Berry and fell in love in 1998, during my sophomore year of college. We spent hours talking and dreaming about our future together. Then came the day when I said, \"I want to adopt our children.\" The look on Mike's face was confusion and surprise.
